Moments earlier, they\\'d hugged, tears welling up in their eyes. Inna had kissed Asia, a tan dachshund dog wrapped up in a warm blanket, carried by Nika in her arms. The girls didn\\'t know when they might see each other again. Nika\\'s family was leaving Kherson, not sure of where they would end up eventually. For now, they were heading to the western city of Khmelnytskyi, hoping they would get some help there. The past few days in Kherson had simply been too much for Nika\\'s mother Elena. \"Before, they [Russian forces] shelled us seven to 10 times a day, now it\\'s 70-80 times, all day long. It\\'s too scary.\" Elena said. \"I love Ukraine and my dear city. But we have to go.\" Elena and her three daughters are among more than four hundred people who have left Kherson since Christmas Day, after a sharp increase in the intensity of the bombardment of the city by the Russian military. Elena left by train, in an evacuation facilitated by the Ukrainian government. Hundreds of people are leaving on their own, a queue of cars building up at the checkpoint leading out of Kherson, filled with terrified civilians. Iryna Antonenko was in tears when we walked up to her car to speak to her. \\'We can\\'t take it anymore. The shelling is so intense. We stayed this whole time and thought it would pass and that we would be lucky. But a strike hit the house next to ours, and my father\\'s home was also shelled,\" she said. She planned to travel to Kryvyi Rih, a city in central Ukraine where she has family. Just last month, there had been jubilant scenes in Kherson. Taken by Russian forces on the second day of the invasion, the city was liberated on 11 November. Close to the spot where masses had gathered waving Ukrainian flags to celebrate being freed from Russian control, a mortar attack on Christmas Eve left eleven dead, and dozens injured. Among the dead were a social worker, a butcher and a woman selling mobile Sim cards - ordinary people working at or visiting the city\\'s central market. That day, Kherson was hit by mortars 41 times, according to the Ukrainian government. The Russians are firing from the left (east) bank of the Dnipro river, where they withdrew to; the waterway has become a de facto frontline in the south of Ukraine.

It is a city haunted by relentless and indiscriminate attacks.  My nights are peaceful at last, after air raids trauma in Ukraine Ukraine leader delivers defiant Christmas message', 'The US Supreme Court has voted to keep in place a controversial Trump-era policy that blocked thousands of people from crossing the US-Mexico border. Title 42 gives the government power to automatically expel undocumented migrants seeking entry.  The potential lifting of the policy had prompted concerns that the number of migrants at the border would rise. The Biden administration said it would comply with the ruling but called for reform of immigration policy.  \"We are advancing our preparations to manage the border in a secure, orderly, and humane way when Title 42 eventually lifts and will continue expanding legal pathways for immigration,\" it said in a statement. Bill Cassidy, a Republican senator for Louisiana, said removing Title 42 \"would have made our border crisis worse, and the White House seemed willing to let that happen\". \"Glad to see the Supreme Court step in to preserve it, but we need a permanent solution,\" he said on Twitter. Miguel Colmenares, a Venezuelan migrant in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, said: \"It breaks my heart that we have to keep waiting.\" \"I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do, I haven\\'t got any money and my family\\'s waiting for me,\" the 27-year-old told Reuters news agency. The Title 42 policy - applied about 2.5 million times since March 2020 - was originally due to expire on 21 December but, two days before the deadline, Chief Supreme Court Justice John Roberts blocked its termination.  The court\\'s decision was in response to an emergency appeal from some Republican-led states who had asked for the policy to remain in place.  On Tuesday, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to extend the temporary stay ordered by Justice Roberts while the case moved forward.   Additionally, the nine Supreme Court justices will hear oral arguments on whether the states can intervene in defence of the policy.  Arguments are likely to take place in February or March 2023. A decision is due by the end of June.   The decision will be a blow to immigration activists, who had sued to end Title 42, arguing it was contrary to international obligations to give people asylum. Proponents of Title 42 and officials in many border communities, however, argued that lifting the policy would lead to an increase in arrivals at the border, putting a strain on resources.  In court documents filed last week, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said the government recognised that the end of Title 42 orders would probably \"lead to disruption and a temporary increase in unlawful border crossings\".   \"The government in no way seeks to minimize the seriousness of that problem,\" she added. \"But the solution to that immigration problem cannot be to extend indefinitely a public-health measure that all now acknowledge has outlived its public-health justification.\"  On the border, local governments and humanitarian organisations have warned that they are already overburdened and ill-prepared for an additional influx of asylum seekers.  In the Texan city of El Paso, for example, authorities last week declared a state of emergency and set up a makeshift 1,000-bed shelter in the city\\'s convention centre as part of a wider plan to cope with the growing number of asylum seekers on the city\\'s streets. Speaking to the BBC last week, officials in the city had expressed concern that they would be unable to handle a significant increase in the number of people that need food, shelter and help arranging transport further into the US.   Susan Goodell, chief executive of El Pasoans Fighting Hunger Foodbank, said local non-governmental organisations had been told to expect \"additional spikes\" if Title 42 was lifted.

The Taliban have banned women from attending university and working for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) within the last week. The 15-member Security Council said it was \"deeply alarmed\" by the increasing restrictions on women\\'s education. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the latest restrictions \"must be revoked\". A statement from the Council called for the \"full, equal, and meaningful participation of women and girls in Afghanistan\".  It urged the Taliban \"to reopen schools and swiftly reverse these policies and practices, which represents an increasing erosion for the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\" The ban on female humanitarian workers \"would have a significant and immediate impact for humanitarian operations in country\", including for the UN, it added. Mr Guterres said that the latest restrictions were \"unjustifiable human rights violations\". \"Actions to exclude and silence women and girls continue to cause immense suffering and major setbacks to the potential of the Afghan people,\" he wrote on Twitter. At least five top NGOs halted work in Afghanistan after women were banned from working for them by the Taliban government. Care International, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and Save the Children said they could not continue their work \"without our female staff\". The International Rescue Committee also suspended services while Islamic Relief said it was stopping most of its work. The Taliban last week arrested five women taking part in a protest in the Afghan capital, Kabul, over the ban on female education. Three journalists were also arrested.  Since seizing back control of the country last year, the Taliban have steadily restricted women\\'s rights - despite promising their rule would be softer than the regime seen in the 1990s. As well as the bans on NGO workers and female university students - in the case of students, now being enforced by armed guards - secondary schools for girls remain closed in most provinces. Women have also been prevented from entering parks and gyms, among other public places.
