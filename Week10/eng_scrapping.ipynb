However, in the real world of work, family and being a carer, my weekly swim feels like an achievement. We are recommended to do nearly two and a half hours (150 minutes) of moderate-intensity exercise each week. About a quarter of the population do not even manage half an hour.So is there something easier we can aim for? What is the least amount of exercise that will start to improve our health? Someone who is keen to make exercise advice less intimidating is Dr Zoe Saynor, assistant professor of clinical exercise physiology at Portsmouth University, not to mention a retired elite-level rugby player. She is going to help me look for an answer. To this end, I\\'ve been wearing an activity tracker for a week.Image caption, Dr Zoe Saynor invited me to her laboratory at the University of PortsmouthI\\'m going to get my excuses in early - it was an incredibly busy week at work, and I was tied to my desk most of the time I was wearing it. The results are still horrifying. I managed only one minute of vigorous exercise (equivalent to running) every day, and 16 minutes of moderate exercise (something like a brisk walk). \"That\\'s a picture that we see time and time again in lots of people living in modern society,\" says Dr Saynor.Whatever state my body is in, a lot is going to depend on that single hour of swimming I squeeze in most weekends. Listen to Inside Health podcast: The lazy guide to exerciseGo fast, or go far? If you want to spend less time exercising - but still achieve high results - then the only option is to work harder.\"There\\'s clear evidence that if you want to do shorter exercise sessions, they need to be of a higher intensity,\" says Dr Saynor.In official guidance, the alternative to doing 150 minutes of moderate activity is to do 75 minutes vigorously.High-intensity interval training (HIIT), involving short but very explosive bouts of activity, gets a lot of attention. However, Dr Saynor says most people cannot stick to it because HIIT requires exercising at such intense levels.What is the bare minimum?When it comes down to the least amount of exercise people should do, Dr Saynor says she is a firm believer in 5,000 to 6,000 steps a day. It is easy to scoff at advice to get off the bus one stop early, or go for a stroll on your lunch break but it does seem to make a difference. A study of nearly 80,000 people published in JAMA Internal Medicine showed that walking a bit more every day reduced the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease or an early death. That pattern continues until you reach about 10,000 steps a day - again, faster steps are worth more than slow ones. \"If you have no time to suddenly do 10,000 steps a day, can we get you to do 5,000 steps faster? We will see an improvement in your health,\" Dr Saynor says.You do not even have to do formal exercise like going for a run, hitting the gym or swimming to see a noticeable health benefit. A study, published in Nature Medicine, looked at 25,000 people who do not \"exercise\" as such but perform small vigorous bouts of activity in day-to-day life. This could be really unextraordinary stuff - running for a train, pushing the vacuum cleaner around, playing with the kids or the dogs, carrying in the heavy shopping or taking the stairs. The research showed between three and four minutes of short vigorous activity in bursts over the day had a profound health benefit.\"The people that are displaying this intermittent activity can reduce their risk of major diseases, such as heart disease and cancer, by up to 50%,\" Mark Hamer, professor of sport and exercise medicine at University College London, tells me. \"Over the last decade, the guidelines have been slowly edging away from the message of 30 minutes a day more towards the message of \\'anything counts\\', and I think these results back up that message.\" Image source, Getty ImagesLie back in the bath - and get fit?If you still do not have time to do it, there may be another way - and it sounds much more enjoyable.How does a bath, hot tub or sauna sound?I have changed into my favourite swim shorts - a fetching pink-flamingo pair - and I am being lowered into a very warm bath. This is a precisely controlled experiment so I cannot just hop in. Researcher Thomas James has to winch me into a pool of water at 40C so only my head and neck are above water.The point of 40C is that it is higher than my core body temperature (37C), so all the time I am in here my body is working hard to lose heat. Very quickly I can feel the sweat beading on my forehead but on the rest of my body it is just being washed away and is not cooling me down. \"Hot water is actually particularly lethal in this respect,\" says Mr James.If I spent too long in here I would overheat and die of heatstroke. My heart pumps harder and more quickly as it tries to lose heat by getting blood closer to the surface of my skin. \"Your heart will be working hard, similar to what you would see with light intensity exercise,\" he says. \"We\\'re seeing reductions in blood pressure, even in healthy people.\"The big idea is to enhance exercise. \"This is a really good way of mimicking some of those benefits you get from exercise but the evidence is certainly pretty clear that exercise is best and then the two together get the biggest health benefits,\" says Mr James, adding: \"I think this will really play a big part in the future.\"So if you go to the gym and then hit the sauna or a hot tub afterwards you might get a cheeky boost. However, the team at Portsmouth caution people to stick to the recommendations. \"Don\\'t go, \\'I\\'m going to stay in here as long as I can.\\' Do it for enjoyment,\" says Mr James.The advice is often between 10 and 20 minutes depending on exactly what facilities you are using, so do check. Obviously all of us should be aiming to do the recommended amount of exercise but, given that many of us find that impossible, it is hugely reassuring that there are significant benefits to be had just by doing a little bit more than we are already.Inside Health was produced by Erika Wright.

They will also name a new premier, the second-in-command after Mr Xi, as the incumbent Li Keqiang departs.The Two Sessions, as the meetings are known, are an annual affair.But this year\\'s sessions are particularly significant as delegates are expected to reshape several key Communist Party and state institutions. They will also tighten control over bodies overseeing the finance sector and scientific and technology work, while \"strengthening party-building work\" in private businesses, according to state media.The moves will likely further blur the lines between the Chinese Communist Party and the government, and consolidate the party\\'s control of the private sector.This comes amid an ongoing corruption crackdown which has seen a string of high-profile businessmen disappear in recent years. The latest person to go missing was one of China\\'s top dealmakers in the tech sector.China\\'s Two Sessions: The basicsThe Two Sessions in Beijing are the annual meetings of China\\'s legislature and top political advisory body which attract thousands of representatives from across the countryThe National People\\'s Congress is the country\\'s equivalent of a parliament that is, in theory, the most powerful state organ. In reality it acts as a rubber-stamp body for the ruling Chinese Communist Party, passing key laws on decisions that have already been made The Chinese People\\'s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which has no real legislative power, draws its members from various sectors of society. Their debates are worth noting for emerging social and economic issuesThis week\\'s NPC meeting will also formalise Mr Xi\\'s leadership of the country, as he will be elected president of China and head of the armed forces.He secured his position in the echelons of Chinese power in October last year, when the Communist Party re-elected him as their leader for a third term. It was a break from decades-long tradition, as no other party leader besides Communist China\\'s first leader, Mao Zedong, will have served for this long. In the 2018 NPC meeting, lawmakers had approved the removal of term limits on the presidency, effectively allowing Mr Xi to remain leader for life.Mr Xi\\'s appointment comes as he faces domestic pressure to turn around an economy battered by his zero-Covid strategy and crackdowns in various business sectors.Abroad, he is navigating worsening ties with the US over the Ukraine war and the recent spy balloon saga, even as he warms his embrace of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.Xi\\'s path to a historic third term, explainedXi Jinping\\'s party is just getting startedThe NPC will also unveil the new Premier, China\\'s equivalent of a prime minister who traditionally oversees the economy and administrative aspects of governance.Li Qiang, one of Mr Xi\\'s most trusted colleagues, is expected to assume the role. As the Shanghai party secretary, he oversaw a prolonged and painful Covid lockdown that angered locals and made international headlines. Outgoing premier Li Keqiang, who was ousted in the leadership reshuffle at October\\'s party congress, will deliver his last work report speech. The political appointments for the rest of the Politburo Standing Committee, the equivalent of Mr Xi\\'s cabinet, will also be announced.Many will be watching to see who fills several key positions, such as the commerce minister, head of the national development and reform commission, propaganda chief, and head of state security.Observers say the team was picked more for their loyalty to Mr Xi and the party, rather than for their expertise.Who are the men who rule China now?Related TopicsXi JinpingAsiaChinaMore on this storyXi cements power by packing top team with loyalists23 October 2022Xi\\'s path to a historic third term, explained17 October 2022Xi Jinping\\'s party is just getting started24 October 2022Top StoriesChina looks at reforms to deepen Xi\\'s controlPublished8 hours agoHistoric ocean treaty agreed after decade of talksPublished2 hours agoInside the enclave surrounded by pro-Russia forcesPublished5 hours agoFeatures\\'The nurses wanted me to feel guilty about my abortionâ\\x80\\x99From Afghan TV fame to a US factory floorWhen is Eurovision and how do you get tickets?Do you know this baby?

The emergence of multiplexes led to their slow demise and now, there are just a few hundred of them left. Cinematographer Hemant Chaturvedi has been chronicling the last vestiges of a dying tradition. India\\'s single-screen cinemas were grand structures, built to accommodate large audiences and boasted diverse architectural styles. Chaturvedi began his project in 2019, and has photographed 950 theatres across 15 states so far. \"In the past 25 years, the number of single-screen cinemas has dwindled from 24,000 to 9,000,\" he says. Some have been demolished to make space for malls and buildings, others are in ruins as they\\'ve lost their clients. \"These theatres were the building blocks of India\\'s cinema-viewing culture. They helped people enjoy films even in the smallest towns across India,\" Chaturvedi says.The idea of the project struck him when he took a trip to his grandparents\\' home in Uttar Pradesh state\\'s Allahabad city. There, he revisited Lakshmi Talkies, a theatre he had frequented as a child, but was now shut. In the crumbling structure was a statue of a goddess after whom the theatre was named, but she was covered in dust and was missing an arm.Chaturvedi says it made him realise how the city was losing so much of its history to urbanisation. From there began his quest to document India\\'s single-screen cinemas. Image source, Hemant ChaturvediImage caption, Niranjan Talkies is a sprawling art deco hall in Allahabad cityNiranjan Talkies in Uttar Pradesh was built in the 1940s but shuttered its doors around 1989 due to a dispute over the property. In its heydays, it was an impressive structure with its spacious interiors, art deco design and sunburst mosaic floors. The theatre is in ruins now but traces of its grandeur peek out in places that have survived the ravages of time.\"It is believed to be the first air-conditioned cinema in Allahabad city,\" says Chaturvedi. \"Locals told me how their grandparents would gather outside the exit towards the end of a film so that they could enjoy the air-conditioned air as people left the theatre.\"Image source, Hemant ChaturvediImage caption, Ganga Talkies in Bikaner was built in 1932Ganga Talkies in Rajasthan state is said to have been built by the ruling king of the time. The theatre has been shut for the past 20 years, but in dusty corners and on crumbling walls, one finds a wealth of memorabilia, including the original posters of Shammi Kapoor\\'s 1961 hit Junglee and Nargis\\' last film, Raat Aur Din (1967). Image source, Hemant ChaturvediImage caption, The century-old Vijayanand Talkies is said to be the oldest theatre in Nashik cityVijayanand Talkies in the western state of Maharashtra was built in 1914. Local legend has it that Dadasaheb Phalke - who made Raja Harishchandra, India\\'s first full-length feature film - used to screen black and white films on a white cloth tied between two trees on a plot of land near this theatre. \"Apparently, people were terrified seeing the moving images, and thought it was a result of black magic. So they trashed Dadasaheb, broke his projector and burnt his films,\" Chaturvedi says. \"The local police had to conduct drives informing people that he was showing a new technology called cinema and that it was not jaadu tona (black magic).\"Image source, Hemant ChaturvediImage caption, Royal Talkies received the first license for cinema exhibition in Bombay in the early 1900sRoyal Talkies in Mumbai is located in an area that was called \\'Play House\\' in the 1800s, because the stretch had many theatres for plays and musicals. They were converted into movie halls after cinema came to India in the 1900s.\"The theatres that are still standing have green room areas and stages behind the screen,\" says Chaturvedi. \"At Royal Talkies I chanced upon two old letterheads from 1950 and 1962. They had the first and only physical evidence I\\'ve found of the term \\'Play House\\' being used for the area,\" he adds.Image source, Hemant ChaturvediImage caption, The ticket window in WadhwanIn the erstwhile princely state of Wadhwan in Gujarat, there stands a dilapidated structure with a solitary ticket window that has a fascinating backstory.Legend has it that the king of Wadhwan booked a cinÃ©matographe - an early film projector invented by the Lumiere Brothers - for 10,000 rupees ($121 Â£99) on a trip to Mumbai (then called Bombay) in 1896.Ten years later the projector arrived.

The emergence of multiplexes led to their slow demise and now, there are just a few hundred of them left. Cinematographer Hemant Chaturvedi has been chronicling the last vestiges of a dying tradition. India\\'s single-screen cinemas were grand structures, built to accommodate large audiences and boasted diverse architectural styles. Chaturvedi began his project in 2019, and has photographed 950 theatres across 15 states so far. \"In the past 25 years, the number of single-screen cinemas has dwindled from 24,000 to 9,000,\" he says. Some have been demolished to make space for malls and buildings, others are in ruins as they\\'ve lost their clients. \"These theatres were the building blocks of India\\'s cinema-viewing culture. They helped people enjoy films even in the smallest towns across India,\" Chaturvedi says.The idea of the project struck him when he took a trip to his grandparents\\' home in Uttar Pradesh state\\'s Allahabad city. There, he revisited Lakshmi Talkies, a theatre he had frequented as a child, but was now shut. In the crumbling structure was a statue of a goddess after whom the theatre was named, but she was covered in dust and was missing an arm.Chaturvedi says it made him realise how the city was losing so much of its history to urbanisation. From there began his quest to document India\\'s single-screen cinemas. Image source, Hemant ChaturvediImage caption, Niranjan Talkies is a sprawling art deco hall in Allahabad cityNiranjan Talkies in Uttar Pradesh was built in the 1940s but shuttered its doors around 1989 due to a dispute over the property. In its heydays, it was an impressive structure with its spacious interiors, art deco design and sunburst mosaic floors. The theatre is in ruins now but traces of its grandeur peek out in places that have survived the ravages of time.\"It is believed to be the first air-conditioned cinema in Allahabad city,\" says Chaturvedi. \"Locals told me how their grandparents would gather outside the exit towards the end of a film so that they could enjoy the air-conditioned air as people left the theatre.\"Image source, Hemant ChaturvediImage caption, Ganga Talkies in Bikaner was built in 1932Ganga Talkies in Rajasthan state is said to have been built by the ruling king of the time. The theatre has been shut for the past 20 years, but in dusty corners and on crumbling walls, one finds a wealth of memorabilia, including the original posters of Shammi Kapoor\\'s 1961 hit Junglee and Nargis\\' last film, Raat Aur Din (1967). Image source, Hemant ChaturvediImage caption, The century-old Vijayanand Talkies is said to be the oldest theatre in Nashik cityVijayanand Talkies in the western state of Maharashtra was built in 1914. Local legend has it that Dadasaheb Phalke - who made Raja Harishchandra, India\\'s first full-length feature film - used to screen black and white films on a white cloth tied between two trees on a plot of land near this theatre. \"Apparently, people were terrified seeing the moving images, and thought it was a result of black magic. So they trashed Dadasaheb, broke his projector and burnt his films,\" Chaturvedi says. \"The local police had to conduct drives informing people that he was showing a new technology called cinema and that it was not jaadu tona (black magic).\"Image source, Hemant ChaturvediImage caption, Royal Talkies received the first license for cinema exhibition in Bombay in the early 1900sRoyal Talkies in Mumbai is located in an area that was called \\'Play House\\' in the 1800s, because the stretch had many theatres for plays and musicals. They were converted into movie halls after cinema came to India in the 1900s.\"The theatres that are still standing have green room areas and stages behind the screen,\" says Chaturvedi. \"At Royal Talkies I chanced upon two old letterheads from 1950 and 1962. They had the first and only physical evidence I\\'ve found of the term \\'Play House\\' being used for the area,\" he adds.Image source, Hemant ChaturvediImage caption, The ticket window in WadhwanIn the erstwhile princely state of Wadhwan in Gujarat, there stands a dilapidated structure with a solitary ticket window that has a fascinating backstory.Legend has it that the king of Wadhwan booked a cinÃ©matographe - an early film projector invented by the Lumiere Brothers - for 10,000 rupees ($121 Â£99) on a trip to Mumbai (then called Bombay) in 1896.Ten years later the projector arrived. It was installed in the open air theatre, which became one of the first ones in India to screen silent movies, according to Chaturvedi. Today only the ticket window of the theatre exists.

At the health centre where she had gone for treatment, she says she overheard one doctor saying to a colleague: \"When will these girls learn to keep their legs closed?\" MarÃ\\xada lives in Salta, a religiously conservative province in north-west Argentina, where many healthcare workers are still against abortion. She was eventually given a pill to end her pregnancy, but she says the nurses were reluctant to treat her and wanted to make her feel guilty: \"After I expelled the pregnancy tissue, I could see the foetus.\"\"The nurses put it in a jar to make sure I saw it and they told me, \\'This could have been your child.\\'\"Argentina relaxed its law on abortion in 2020, allowing a woman to choose to terminate her pregnancy in the first 14 weeks, Previously, it was only allowed in the case of rape or if the woman\\'s life or health was at risk. Abortion is a highly contentious issue in Argentina, where more than 60% of people are Catholic and 15% are evangelical Christians, with the leadership of both groups opposing the practice.Image caption, Maria says she was shown the foetus and told: \"This could have been your child.\"The new law allows health workers in Argentina to abstain from performing abortions. \"As soon as the law was passed, I declared myself a conscientious objector,\" says Dr Carlos Franco, a paediatrician from the same area as MarÃ\\xada, who estimates that 90% of health workers in the province\\'s main public hospital have done the same. He says his years studying embryology left him with the belief that life begins at fertilisation.\"My duty, as a doctor, is to take care and protect the human life from the embryonic stage,\" he adds.This helps explain why women like MarÃ\\xada are having so much trouble accessing legal abortions.MarÃ\\xada had initially spent two days at the health centre just waiting to be seen by a doctor. Eventually, when none came, she turned to social media for help and found MÃ³nica Rodriguez, a local activist, who helped her file a complaint at the hospital and secure an appointment. Ms Rodriguez says she gets about 100 phone calls a month from women in Salta who are having similar difficulty getting access to safe abortions. She tells the BBC her main job is simply to listen: \"While I don\\'t recommend abortion, I don\\'t romanticise motherhood either.\"The campaign to expand abortion rights in Argentina has taken decades, but Valeria Isla, director of sexual and reproductive health at the national health ministry, says that significant progress has been made. She cites official figures showing that the number of mothers dying from abortions has dropped by 40% since the law was enacted in 2021. The number of public health centres that provide abortions has gone up by more than a half over the same period, and the drug misoprostol, which chemically induces abortions, is now being manufactured in the country, making it more widely available. Long waits for treatment and the social stigma surrounding abortions can make women vulnerable to corrupt practices. There have been cases reported of women being forced to pay hundreds of dollars for treatment that should be free in public health facilities. \"There is a mafia,\" says Dr MarÃ\\xada Laura Lerma, a psychologist based in a remote mountain community in Jujuy in the country\\'s north-west. \"In many rural areas of Argentina, some doctors who work in the public hospital take patients to their private clinics.\" The government has urged women to report allegations of corruption, but many women in rural areas are too scared to do so. Image caption, Anti-abortion activists are trying to block the law allowing the procedureDoctors who do agree to perform abortions have been targeted with spurious legal complaints. In September 2021, one doctor in Salta was briefly detained following an accusation by the aunt of a 21-year-old patient that she had performed an \"illegal abortion\". The accusation was untrue, but it took a year for a court to dismiss the case. \"Anti-abortion organisations have historical connections with judges and people in power and they use them to generate fear and endanger the freedom of doctors who provide abortions,\" says RocÃ\\xado GarcÃ\\xada Garro, a lawyer for pro-choice campaign group Catholics for the Right to Decide.Anti-abortion campaigners are also using the courts to try and get the abortion law declared unconstitutional.Cristina Fiore, a local parliament representative in Salta, is one of them.\"We believe human life starts at conception and we are against this throwaway culture,\" she says. So far, all legal challenges have failed. MarÃ\\xada is clear why she made the choice not to continue with her pregnancy: \"I had never wanted to be a mumâ\\x80¦ My parents abandoned me and that\\'s a trauma which has taken me years to overcome.\" She says she wants training to be improved for nurses and gynaecologists to prevent others suffering like her.\"There are many women, especially in the small rural towns, who are discriminated against like me and not all of them dare to speak.\"*Names of some contributors have been changed to protect their privacy.Related TopicsAbortionArgentinaMore on this storyCrowds celebrate as Argentina legalises abortion30 December 2020\\'I was sentenced to 30 years for suffering a miscarriage\\'30 June 2022Colombia decriminalises abortion in first 24 weeks22 February 2022Top StoriesChina looks at reforms to deepen Xi\\'s controlPublished7 hours agoHistoric ocean treaty agreed after decade of talksPublished1 hour agoInside the enclave surrounded by pro-Russia forcesPublished4 hours agoFeatures\\'The nurses wanted me to feel guilty about my abortionâ\\x80\\x99From Afghan TV fame to a US factory floorWhen is Eurovision and how do you get tickets?Do you know this baby?

MarÃ\\xada is clear why she made the choice not to continue with her pregnancy: \"I had never wanted to be a mumâ\\x80¦ My parents abandoned me and that\\'s a trauma which has taken me years to overcome.\" She says she wants training to be improved for nurses and gynaecologists to prevent others suffering like her.\"There are many women, especially in the small rural towns, who are discriminated against like me and not all of them dare to speak.\"*Names of some contributors have been changed to protect their privacy.Related TopicsAbortionArgentinaMore on this storyCrowds celebrate as Argentina legalises abortion30 December 2020\\'I was sentenced to 30 years for suffering a miscarriage\\'30 June 2022Colombia decriminalises abortion in first 24 weeks22 February 2022Top StoriesChina looks at reforms to deepen Xi\\'s controlPublished7 hours agoHistoric ocean treaty agreed after decade of talksPublished1 hour agoInside the enclave surrounded by pro-Russia forcesPublished4 hours agoFeatures\\'The nurses wanted me to feel guilty about my abortionâ\\x80\\x99From Afghan TV fame to a US factory floorWhen is Eurovision and how do you get tickets?Do you know this baby?

The UK is staging the contest on behalf of 2022 winners Ukraine.When is Eurovision? The Eurovision final will take place at the M&S Bank Arena on the waterfront in Liverpool on Saturday 13 May.It will be the first Eurovision Song Contest to be held in the UK for 25 years.The competition is made up of two semi-finals and the grand final - all of which will be broadcast live.This year\\'s semis will take place on Tuesday 9 May and Thursday 11 May. Ten countries from each will go through to the final.In addition, the UK, Italy, France, Spain, and Germany are already guaranteed a spot in the final, along with last year\\'s winners, Ukraine.This means 26 countries will compete in the final. Eurovision\\'s semi-final allocation draw explainedHow can I get Eurovision tickets and what will they cost?Tickets for all of the Eurovision shows will go on sale at 12:00 GMT on Tuesday 7 March.As well as the three televised live shows - the semi-finals and the final - there are six preview shows which double up as dress rehearsals.Image caption, A mock-up of how Liverpool\\'s M&S Bank Arena is expected to look hosting the Eurovision Song ContestTickets can only be bought from the UK Ticketmaster website, regardless of where you live.You can only purchase tickets for one show at a time. Prices range from Â£90 to Â£290 for the live semi-final shows, and from Â£160 to Â£380 for the live grand final. Preview show tickets will cost between Â£30 and Â£280.About 3,000 tickets will also be made available to Ukrainians living in the UK.How can I watch Eurovision?In the UK, Eurovision will be broadcast live on BBC One. The programme will be hosted by Graham Norton, Hannah Waddingham, Alesha Dixon and Ukrainian singer Julia Sanina. Image caption, This year\\'s competition is being held in Liverpool on behalf of Ukraine who won last year\\'s eventA special fan zone will accommodate up to 25,000 people at Liverpool\\'s Pier Head, close to the M&S Bank Arena. Events planned include a submarine parade and a rave which will take place simultaneously in Kyiv.Subscribe to the Eurovisioncast podcast on BBC SoundsWhy is the UK hosting Eurovision?Ukraine\\'s Kalush Orchestra won the 2022 Eurovision song contest with their song Stefania. Usually, the winning country hosts the following year\\'s competition. But the ongoing war in Ukraine makes this impossible.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The UK\\'s Sam Ryder finished second to Ukraine in the 2022 contestThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the contest, invited the UK to host it on Ukraine\\'s behalf because its 2022 entrant, Sam Ryder, was runner up. It will be the ninth time the UK has hosted the competition and the fifth time it has done so on behalf of another country.How the UK broke its Eurovision losing streakHow much does Eurovision cost?The 37 broadcasters taking part in the contest each pay an entrance fee to the EBU. In recent years these fees have totalled about Â£5m. The BBC does not make its contribution public.Russia used to be a significant financial contributor, but was expelled from the competition following its invasion of Ukraine. BBC News has been told countries have been asked to pay more to make up for the loss. Three countries have said they will not take part as a result of the increase. Some broadcasters are also thought to be worried about the additional costs of transporting equipment to the UK now it is no longer a member of the EU. Image source, James_StackImage caption, The 2023 contest\\'s slogan is \"United by music\"Staging the event is expected to cost the BBC between Â£8m and Â£17m. The UK government has pledged Â£10m towards operational costs while local authorities in Liverpool have committed Â£4m. How does the voting work?The semi-finals are decided by a public vote, but arrangements for the final are more complicated.Each of the 26 participating countries has a jury whose members rank all the final performances. They award a fixed number of points to their top 10 acts: 12, 10, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two or one.These jury vote results are announced by each country in turn on the night.Then, based on viewer votes, the competing countries also give the other contestants points, using the same scoring system. For the first time, in 2023 public votes from outside Europe will play a part. These worldwide votes will be combined and counted as if they are one other country, will follow the same scoring system.Why does Australia take part in Eurovision?Eurovision has been popular in Australia since the 1980s, and in 2015 it was invited to send an act as part of the contest\\'s 60th anniversary celebrations. It has been allowed to take part ever since. Like European countries, it pays a fee to the EBU to help fund the event. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Kate Miller-Heidkes represented Australia in 2019 in Tel AvivHowever, Australia is barred from hosting. If it were ever to win, it would have to nominate a European nation to stage the contest on its behalf. Other non-European countries including Israel are also allowed participate because they are members of the EBU.Eurovisioncast is available on BBC Sounds, or search wherever you get your podcasts from.Related TopicsSam RyderEurovision Song ContestLiverpoolUkraineRelated Internet LinksThe Eurovision Song Contest official websiteThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top StoriesChina looks at reforms to deepen Xi\\'s controlPublished8 hours agoHistoric ocean treaty agreed after decade of talksPublished2 hours agoInside the enclave surrounded by pro-Russia forcesPublished5 hours agoFeatures\\'The nurses wanted me to feel guilty about my abortionâ\\x80\\x99From Afghan TV fame to a US factory floorWhen is Eurovision and how do you get tickets?Do you know this baby?

The UK is staging the contest on behalf of 2022 winners Ukraine.When is Eurovision? The Eurovision final will take place at the M&S Bank Arena on the waterfront in Liverpool on Saturday 13 May.It will be the first Eurovision Song Contest to be held in the UK for 25 years.The competition is made up of two semi-finals and the grand final - all of which will be broadcast live.This year\\'s semis will take place on Tuesday 9 May and Thursday 11 May. Ten countries from each will go through to the final.In addition, the UK, Italy, France, Spain, and Germany are already guaranteed a spot in the final, along with last year\\'s winners, Ukraine.This means 26 countries will compete in the final. Eurovision\\'s semi-final allocation draw explainedHow can I get Eurovision tickets and what will they cost?Tickets for all of the Eurovision shows will go on sale at 12:00 GMT on Tuesday 7 March.As well as the three televised live shows - the semi-finals and the final - there are six preview shows which double up as dress rehearsals.Image caption, A mock-up of how Liverpool\\'s M&S Bank Arena is expected to look hosting the Eurovision Song ContestTickets can only be bought from the UK Ticketmaster website, regardless of where you live.You can only purchase tickets for one show at a time. Prices range from Â£90 to Â£290 for the live semi-final shows, and from Â£160 to Â£380 for the live grand final. Preview show tickets will cost between Â£30 and Â£280.About 3,000 tickets will also be made available to Ukrainians living in the UK.How can I watch Eurovision?In the UK, Eurovision will be broadcast live on BBC One. The programme will be hosted by Graham Norton, Hannah Waddingham, Alesha Dixon and Ukrainian singer Julia Sanina. Image caption, This year\\'s competition is being held in Liverpool on behalf of Ukraine who won last year\\'s eventA special fan zone will accommodate up to 25,000 people at Liverpool\\'s Pier Head, close to the M&S Bank Arena. Events planned include a submarine parade and a rave which will take place simultaneously in Kyiv.Subscribe to the Eurovisioncast podcast on BBC SoundsWhy is the UK hosting Eurovision?Ukraine\\'s Kalush Orchestra won the 2022 Eurovision song contest with their song Stefania. Usually, the winning country hosts the following year\\'s competition. But the ongoing war in Ukraine makes this impossible.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The UK\\'s Sam Ryder finished second to Ukraine in the 2022 contestThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the contest, invited the UK to host it on Ukraine\\'s behalf because its 2022 entrant, Sam Ryder, was runner up. It will be the ninth time the UK has hosted the competition and the fifth time it has done so on behalf of another country.How the UK broke its Eurovision losing streakHow much does Eurovision cost?The 37 broadcasters taking part in the contest each pay an entrance fee to the EBU. In recent years these fees have totalled about Â£5m. The BBC does not make its contribution public.Russia used to be a significant financial contributor, but was expelled from the competition following its invasion of Ukraine. BBC News has been told countries have been asked to pay more to make up for the loss. Three countries have said they will not take part as a result of the increase. Some broadcasters are also thought to be worried about the additional costs of transporting equipment to the UK now it is no longer a member of the EU. Image source, James_StackImage caption, The 2023 contest\\'s slogan is \"United by music\"Staging the event is expected to cost the BBC between Â£8m and Â£17m. The UK government has pledged Â£10m towards operational costs while local authorities in Liverpool have committed Â£4m. How does the voting work?The semi-finals are decided by a public vote, but arrangements for the final are more complicated.Each of the 26 participating countries has a jury whose members rank all the final performances. They award a fixed number of points to their top 10 acts: 12, 10, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two or one.These jury vote results are announced by each country in turn on the night.Then, based on viewer votes, the competing countries also give the other contestants points, using the same scoring system. For the first time, in 2023 public votes from outside Europe will play a part. These worldwide votes will be combined and counted as if they are one other country, will follow the same scoring system.Why does Australia take part in Eurovision?Eurovision has been popular in Australia since the 1980s, and in 2015 it was invited to send an act as part of the contest\\'s 60th anniversary celebrations. It has been allowed to take part ever since. Like European countries, it pays a fee to the EBU to help fund the event. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Kate Miller-Heidkes represented Australia in 2019 in Tel AvivHowever, Australia is barred from hosting. If it were ever to win, it would have to nominate a European nation to stage the contest on its behalf. Other non-European countries including Israel are also allowed participate because they are members of the EBU.Eurovisioncast is available on BBC Sounds, or search wherever you get your podcasts from.Related TopicsSam RyderEurovision Song ContestLiverpoolUkraineRelated Internet LinksThe Eurovision Song Contest official websiteThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top StoriesChina looks at reforms to deepen Xi\\'s controlPublished8 hours agoHistoric ocean treaty agreed after decade of talksPublished2 hours agoInside the enclave surrounded by pro-Russia forcesPublished5 hours agoFeatures\\'The nurses wanted me to feel guilty about my abortionâ\\x80\\x99From Afghan TV fame to a US factory floorWhen is Eurovision and how do you get tickets?Do you know this baby?

However, it did not provide any details about the investigation or Mr Bao\\'s whereabouts.High-profile Chinese billionaire reported missingJack Ma to give up control of Ant GroupAuthorities took Mr Bao away earlier this month to assist in an investigation into a former colleague, Cong Lin, the company\\'s former president, according to the Reuters news agency.Mr Bao\\'s disappearance comes against the backdrop of a crackdown on leading technology companies by Chinese authorities.In late 2020, Alibaba founder Jack Ma also disappeared from public view for three months, after making comments critical of market regulators. He had been due to publicly list his digital payments firm Ant Financial - which would have most likely made him the richest man in China.Mr Bao\\'s disappearance also comes after a series of cases of high-profile Chinese executives going missing as part of Chinese President Xi Jinping\\'s anti-corruption campaign.In 2015 alone, at least five executives became unreachable, including Fosun Group Chairman Guo Guangchang. The company later said he was assisting with investigations over a personal matter.Chinese-Canadian businessman Xiao Jianhua was also taken in 2017. He had been one of China\\'s richest people and last year was jailed for corruption.Mr Bao is seen as a titan in China\\'s tech industry, having executed many of the trades that have shaped its online consumer economy. He founded China Renaissance in 2005 after a banking career at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse.In a 2018 article, Mr Bao wrote that his company had \"cross[ed] paths\" with 70% of the internet companies known by the Chinese public.Related TopicsChinaBankingMore on this storyHigh-profile Chinese billionaire reported missing17 FebruaryJack Ma to give up control of Ant Group8 JanuaryBillionaire jailed for 13 years in China19 August 2022Is Alibaba\\'s fate a warning to Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s tech giants?15 April 2021China\\'s tech giants fall under regulator\\'s pressure16 March 2021China tycoon critical of Xi gets 18 years in jail22 September 2020Top StoriesChina looks at reforms to deepen Xi\\'s controlPublished8 hours agoHistoric ocean treaty agreed after decade of talksPublished2 hours agoInside the enclave surrounded by pro-Russia forcesPublished5 hours agoFeatures\\'The nurses wanted me to feel guilty about my abortionâ\\x80\\x99From Afghan TV fame to a US factory floorWhen is Eurovision and how do you get tickets?Do you know this baby?

However, it did not provide any details about the investigation or Mr Bao\\'s whereabouts.High-profile Chinese billionaire reported missingJack Ma to give up control of Ant GroupAuthorities took Mr Bao away earlier this month to assist in an investigation into a former colleague, Cong Lin, the company\\'s former president, according to the Reuters news agency.Mr Bao\\'s disappearance comes against the backdrop of a crackdown on leading technology companies by Chinese authorities.In late 2020, Alibaba founder Jack Ma also disappeared from public view for three months, after making comments critical of market regulators. He had been due to publicly list his digital payments firm Ant Financial - which would have most likely made him the richest man in China.Mr Bao\\'s disappearance also comes after a series of cases of high-profile Chinese executives going missing as part of Chinese President Xi Jinping\\'s anti-corruption campaign.In 2015 alone, at least five executives became unreachable, including Fosun Group Chairman Guo Guangchang. The company later said he was assisting with investigations over a personal matter.Chinese-Canadian businessman Xiao Jianhua was also taken in 2017. He had been one of China\\'s richest people and last year was jailed for corruption.Mr Bao is seen as a titan in China\\'s tech industry, having executed many of the trades that have shaped its online consumer economy. He founded China Renaissance in 2005 after a banking career at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse.In a 2018 article, Mr Bao wrote that his company had \"cross[ed] paths\" with 70% of the internet companies known by the Chinese public.Related TopicsChinaBankingMore on this storyHigh-profile Chinese billionaire reported missing17 FebruaryJack Ma to give up control of Ant Group8 JanuaryBillionaire jailed for 13 years in China19 August 2022Is Alibaba\\'s fate a warning to Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s tech giants?15 April 2021China\\'s tech giants fall under regulator\\'s pressure16 March 2021China tycoon critical of Xi gets 18 years in jail22 September 2020Top StoriesChina looks at reforms to deepen Xi\\'s controlPublished8 hours agoHistoric ocean treaty agreed after decade of talksPublished2 hours agoInside the enclave surrounded by pro-Russia forcesPublished5 hours agoFeatures\\'The nurses wanted me to feel guilty about my abortionâ\\x80\\x99From Afghan TV fame to a US factory floorWhen is Eurovision and how do you get tickets?Do you know this baby?

Marine life living outside of these protected areas has been at risk from climate change, overfishing and shipping traffic.In detail: The plan to protect the high seasIn the latest assessment of global marine species, nearly 10% were found to be at risk of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). These new protected areas, established in the treaty, will put limits on how much fishing can take place, the routes of shipping lanes and exploration activities like deep sea mining - when minerals are taken from a sea bed 200m or more below the surface. Environmental groups have been concerned that mining processes could disturb animal breeding grounds, create noise pollution and be toxic for marine life.The International Seabed Authority that oversees licensing told the BBC that moving forward \"any future activity in the deep seabed will be subject to strict environmental regulations and oversight to ensure that they are carried out sustainably and responsibly\".Image source, Alexis Rosenfeld/Getty ImagesImage caption, Marine protected areas could help endangered species like the whale shark - the largest living fish - recoverRena Lee, UN Ambassador for Oceans, brought down the gavel after two weeks of negotiations that at times threatened to unravel.Minna Epps, director of the IUCN Ocean team, said the main issue was over the sharing of marine genetic resources.Marine genetic resources are biological material from plants and animals in the ocean that can have benefits for society, such as pharmaceuticals, industrial processes and food. Richer nations currently have the resources and funding to explore the deep ocean but poorer nations wanted to ensure any benefits they find are shared equally. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sea sponges have yielded key ingredients for HIV and cancer treatmentsDr Robert Blasiak, ocean researcher at Stockholm University, said the challenge was that no one knows how much ocean resources are worth and therefore how they could be split.He said: \"If you imagine a big, high-definition, widescreen TV, and if only like three or four of the pixels on that giant screen are working, that\\'s our knowledge of the deep ocean. So we\\'ve recorded about 230,000 species in the ocean, but it\\'s estimated that there are over two million.\"Laura Meller, an oceans campaigner for Greenpeace Nordic, commended countries for \"putting aside differences and delivering a treaty that will let us protect the oceans, build our resilience to climate change and safeguard the lives and livelihoods of billions of people\"\"This is a historic day for conservation and a sign that in a divided world, protecting nature and people can triumph over geopolitics,\" she added.Countries will need to meet again to formerly adopt the agreement and then have plenty of work to do before the treaty can be implemented. Liz Karan, director of Pews Trust ocean governance team, told the BBC: \"It will take some time to take effect. Countries have to ratify it [legally adopt it] for it to enter force. Then there are a lot of institutional bodies like the Science and Technical Committee that have to get set up.\"Related TopicsFishingBiodiversityUnited NationsMiningOceansMore on this storyWhat is the plan to protect the high seas?3 hours ago\\'Magical marine species\\' pushed toward extinction9 December 2022Top StoriesChina looks at reforms to deepen Xi\\'s controlPublished8 hours agoHistoric ocean treaty agreed after decade of talksPublished2 hours agoInside the enclave surrounded by pro-Russia forcesPublished5 hours agoFeatures\\'The nurses wanted me to feel guilty about my abortionâ\\x80\\x99From Afghan TV fame to a US factory floorWhen is Eurovision and how do you get tickets?Do you know this baby?

Marine life living outside of these protected areas has been at risk from climate change, overfishing and shipping traffic.In detail: The plan to protect the high seasIn the latest assessment of global marine species, nearly 10% were found to be at risk of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). These new protected areas, established in the treaty, will put limits on how much fishing can take place, the routes of shipping lanes and exploration activities like deep sea mining - when minerals are taken from a sea bed 200m or more below the surface. Environmental groups have been concerned that mining processes could disturb animal breeding grounds, create noise pollution and be toxic for marine life.The International Seabed Authority that oversees licensing told the BBC that moving forward \"any future activity in the deep seabed will be subject to strict environmental regulations and oversight to ensure that they are carried out sustainably and responsibly\".Image source, Alexis Rosenfeld/Getty ImagesImage caption, Marine protected areas could help endangered species like the whale shark - the largest living fish - recoverRena Lee, UN Ambassador for Oceans, brought down the gavel after two weeks of negotiations that at times threatened to unravel.Minna Epps, director of the IUCN Ocean team, said the main issue was over the sharing of marine genetic resources.Marine genetic resources are biological material from plants and animals in the ocean that can have benefits for society, such as pharmaceuticals, industrial processes and food. Richer nations currently have the resources and funding to explore the deep ocean but poorer nations wanted to ensure any benefits they find are shared equally. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sea sponges have yielded key ingredients for HIV and cancer treatmentsDr Robert Blasiak, ocean researcher at Stockholm University, said the challenge was that no one knows how much ocean resources are worth and therefore how they could be split.He said: \"If you imagine a big, high-definition, widescreen TV, and if only like three or four of the pixels on that giant screen are working, that\\'s our knowledge of the deep ocean. So we\\'ve recorded about 230,000 species in the ocean, but it\\'s estimated that there are over two million.\"Laura Meller, an oceans campaigner for Greenpeace Nordic, commended countries for \"putting aside differences and delivering a treaty that will let us protect the oceans, build our resilience to climate change and safeguard the lives and livelihoods of billions of people\"\"This is a historic day for conservation and a sign that in a divided world, protecting nature and people can triumph over geopolitics,\" she added.Countries will need to meet again to formerly adopt the agreement and then have plenty of work to do before the treaty can be implemented. Liz Karan, director of Pews Trust ocean governance team, told the BBC: \"It will take some time to take effect. Countries have to ratify it [legally adopt it] for it to enter force. Then there are a lot of institutional bodies like the Science and Technical Committee that have to get set up.\"Related TopicsFishingBiodiversityUnited NationsMiningOceansMore on this storyWhat is the plan to protect the high seas?3 hours ago\\'Magical marine species\\' pushed toward extinction9 December 2022Top StoriesChina looks at reforms to deepen Xi\\'s controlPublished8 hours agoHistoric ocean treaty agreed after decade of talksPublished2 hours agoInside the enclave surrounded by pro-Russia forcesPublished5 hours agoFeatures\\'The nurses wanted me to feel guilty about my abortionâ\\x80\\x99From Afghan TV fame to a US factory floorWhen is Eurovision and how do you get tickets?Do you know this baby?

Reflecting on the public response to the work, the Duke of Sussex insisted that he was not a \"victim\" or seeking sympathy. He revealed that his own reaction to the controversial book\\'s publication was to feel \"incredibly free\". Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Prince Harry spoke about the racism experienced by his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex\"I felt a huge weight off my shoulders,\" he told Dr MatÃ©, describing the book as an \"act of service\" to help others break the taboo about speaking about mental health problems.Saturday\\'s discussion focused on the prince\\'s emotions, therapy and thoughts on mental health. But it did not go into recent royal revelations, such as request for Harry and his wife Meghan to vacate Frogmore Cottage - or whether or not he would attend his father\\'s coronation.There were also no mentions of how the Royal Family, including his brother, had felt about his tell-all memoir.Sensational claims in Prince Harry memoirSpare: The weirdest book ever written by a royalPrince Harry described growing up \"feeling slightly different to the rest of my family\" - and had a sense of living in a disconnected \"bubble\", which therapy had helped him burst.In front of an international online audience, he was asked about experiencing an emotionally distant childhood, with a lack of hugs and demonstrations of affection.He said that with his own children, he was \"making sure that I smother them with love and affection\".\"As a father I feel a huge responsibility to ensure that I don\\'t pass on any traumas or... negative experiences that I\\'ve had as a kid,\" he said.He spoke repeatedly about the importance of therapy, even though it could drive a wedge between him and other relations.But he said that he wrongly feared that it would erode his feelings about his mother, Diana, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 when Harry was aged 12.\"One of the things I was most scared about was losing the feeling that I had of my mum... whatever I had managed to hold onto of my mother,\" said Prince Harry.But he hadn\\'t lost those feelings and had come to realise \"that actually she just wanted me to be happy\", he told Dr MatÃ©.Image source, PETER NICHOLLSImage caption, Prince Harry\\'s memoir has been an international best sellerThe prince spoke about being \"eternally grateful\" for his wife Meghan in changing his perspective, calling her an \"exceptional human being\". But he said meeting Meghan had given him a \"crash course\" in the experience of racism, which he described as \"pretty shocking\".Prince Harry also defended the use of psychedelic medicine, saying it had helped him \"deal with the traumas and pains of the past\" and was like the \"cleaning of the windscreen\".He said taking cocaine \"didn\\'t do anything for me\" but that \"marijuana is different, that actually really did help me\".To watch the online interview, the audience had to buy a copy of Prince Harry\\'s best-selling memoir, which had made headlines with its unprecedented account of tensions between the royals and personal revelations.It included claims of a physical altercation with his brother Prince William, and recorded his experiences of taking drugs and losing his virginity.Related TopicsUK Royal FamilyMeghan, Duchess of SussexPrince Harry, Duke of SussexMore on this storyHarry and Meghan told to \\'vacate\\' Frogmore Cottage3 days agoHarry makes sensational claims in new memoir7 JanuaryTop StoriesChina looks at reforms to deepen Xi\\'s controlPublished8 hours agoHistoric ocean treaty agreed after decade of talksPublished2 hours agoInside the enclave surrounded by pro-Russia forcesPublished5 hours agoFeatures\\'The nurses wanted me to feel guilty about my abortionâ\\x80\\x99From Afghan TV fame to a US factory floorWhen is Eurovision and how do you get tickets?Do you know this baby?

Reflecting on the public response to the work, the Duke of Sussex insisted that he was not a \"victim\" or seeking sympathy. He revealed that his own reaction to the controversial book\\'s publication was to feel \"incredibly free\". Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Prince Harry spoke about the racism experienced by his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex\"I felt a huge weight off my shoulders,\" he told Dr MatÃ©, describing the book as an \"act of service\" to help others break the taboo about speaking about mental health problems.Saturday\\'s discussion focused on the prince\\'s emotions, therapy and thoughts on mental health. But it did not go into recent royal revelations, such as request for Harry and his wife Meghan to vacate Frogmore Cottage - or whether or not he would attend his father\\'s coronation.There were also no mentions of how the Royal Family, including his brother, had felt about his tell-all memoir.Sensational claims in Prince Harry memoirSpare: The weirdest book ever written by a royalPrince Harry described growing up \"feeling slightly different to the rest of my family\" - and had a sense of living in a disconnected \"bubble\", which therapy had helped him burst.In front of an international online audience, he was asked about experiencing an emotionally distant childhood, with a lack of hugs and demonstrations of affection.He said that with his own children, he was \"making sure that I smother them with love and affection\".\"As a father I feel a huge responsibility to ensure that I don\\'t pass on any traumas or... negative experiences that I\\'ve had as a kid,\" he said.He spoke repeatedly about the importance of therapy, even though it could drive a wedge between him and other relations.But he said that he wrongly feared that it would erode his feelings about his mother, Diana, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 when Harry was aged 12.\"One of the things I was most scared about was losing the feeling that I had of my mum... whatever I had managed to hold onto of my mother,\" said Prince Harry.But he hadn\\'t lost those feelings and had come to realise \"that actually she just wanted me to be happy\", he told Dr MatÃ©.Image source, PETER NICHOLLSImage caption, Prince Harry\\'s memoir has been an international best sellerThe prince spoke about being \"eternally grateful\" for his wife Meghan in changing his perspective, calling her an \"exceptional human being\". But he said meeting Meghan had given him a \"crash course\" in the experience of racism, which he described as \"pretty shocking\".Prince Harry also defended the use of psychedelic medicine, saying it had helped him \"deal with the traumas and pains of the past\" and was like the \"cleaning of the windscreen\".He said taking cocaine \"didn\\'t do anything for me\" but that \"marijuana is different, that actually really did help me\".To watch the online interview, the audience had to buy a copy of Prince Harry\\'s best-selling memoir, which had made headlines with its unprecedented account of tensions between the royals and personal revelations.It included claims of a physical altercation with his brother Prince William, and recorded his experiences of taking drugs and losing his virginity.Related TopicsUK Royal FamilyMeghan, Duchess of SussexPrince Harry, Duke of SussexMore on this storyHarry and Meghan told to \\'vacate\\' Frogmore Cottage3 days agoHarry makes sensational claims in new memoir7 JanuaryTop StoriesChina looks at reforms to deepen Xi\\'s controlPublished8 hours agoHistoric ocean treaty agreed after decade of talksPublished2 hours agoInside the enclave surrounded by pro-Russia forcesPublished5 hours agoFeatures\\'The nurses wanted me to feel guilty about my abortionâ\\x80\\x99From Afghan TV fame to a US factory floorWhen is Eurovision and how do you get tickets?Do you know this baby?

But when the Taliban swept through the Afghan capital in August 2021, everything changed.\"After I wrote an article and posted it on my Facebook page, I started getting calls from the Taliban, so I went into hiding,\" she told the BBC. For weeks she was forced to move from house to house with her brother to avoid being found.Seventeen months on, Ms Joya, 24, finds herself in a very different place. Gone is the life of interviewing politicians and keeping up with the latest breaking news in Kabul. Today, home is 7,000 miles away in Dayton, Ohio.And though Ms Joya has escaped the Taliban, she still feels stuck.She spends up to 12 hours a day, six days a week working at a manufacturing plant - work, she said, that is mind-numbing and back-breaking. While Ms Joya is not required by her employer to work so many hours, she says she has little choice.Afghan interpreters fear families \\'forgotten\\' by CanadaFrom Afghanistan to Wisconsin\"I need to work to help my family,\" she said, six of whom, including her parents, live in Takhar province in north-eastern Afghanistan, which was captured by the Taliban in June 2021. \"I don\\'t like this job at all, but due to economic problems, I have to work to send money to my family, because they are in a worse situation in Afghanistan,\" she said. \"Here I can earn.\"It has been one year since the US government announced that the tens of thousands of Afghan nationals in its care following the chaotic military pull-out from Afghanistan had been resettled in host communities across the country.Image source, Supplied photoImage caption, For years, Basira Joya worked as a news broadcaster on Afghan televisionWhile dozens of highly-skilled, renowned female Afghan journalists managed to escape the country before and during the Taliban takeover, few have been able to continue their work as reporters.\"They have left their country in such a traumatising way. They have lost everything they had,\" said Zahra Nader, a Canada-based, Afghan journalist who last year founded the online newspaper Zan Times. \"And when you have worked so hard to become a journalist (in Afghanistan), you are proud of what you did. Then suddenly that is taken away from you.\"Ms Nader, who reported for the New York Times in Afghanistan and faced similar difficulties when attempting to continue her career after moving to Canada in 2017, said that since she started Zan Times, she has been inundated with requests from female journalists in exile looking for work.\"They are all professionals, and there are stories to tell,\" she said. \"But unfortunately we don\\'t have any resources to pay them.\"For Mariam Alimi, a photographer from Kabul, her favourite experiences behind the camera saw her travelling Afghanistan depicting its people and places. Working as an editorial photographer for outlets such as the Washington Post and London Times during a 15-year career, the 42-year-old said she used her camera to tell stories of Afghan women breaking barriers in business and sports at a time when the wider narrative was one of conflict and loss. \"I have shot some amazing pictures that have amazing stories behind them,\" she recalled.Today, Ms Alimi\\'s life looks quite a bit different. Having fled the Taliban takeover, she arrived in the US in October 2021, and following a stint in New Jersey, now lives in Maryland. Like Ms Joya, her journalism career has ground to a halt.\"When I came here, I saw a different picture,\" she said. \"It has not been easy to get a job that I\\'m looking for.\"Image source, Supplied photoImage caption, Photographer Mariam Alimi fled Kabul during the Taliban takeover in 2021These days, she works at a senior living community. \"I\\'m enjoying the job, keeping people happy,\" she said. \"But of course, not as much as I enjoyed my job working with my camera.\"To help reboot her career, Ms Alimi said she needs to get a driving licence and start making contacts in the photography world. She said she\\'s lucky that her family have all moved from Afghanistan and are now in the US.But in Ohio, Ms Joya\\'s lot appears decidedly more difficult. She said it has been painful to look on from afar as the Taliban banned women from attending universities and from working with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in December. All the while, she spends up to 72 hours a week working on a factory floor to support herself - at a time of near-record inflation in the US - and her family in rural Afghanistan. Her father, a police officer before the Taliban came to power, recently had to travel thousands of miles to Iran for eye surgery. \"It cost $2,000 for that surgery, so I have to help them financially because they don\\'t have any money,\" she said.Ms Joya is learning English and has not given up on her goal of continuing her journalism career. She has reached out to several Afghan news broadcasting organisations based in Washington DC and London, though none have indicated there may be a position open for her. \"It\\'s still my dream to be a journalist,\" she said.\"It\\'s still something I want to do.\"More like this:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: A teenager in Kabul expresses deep dismay at Taliban university banRelated TopicsAfghanistanWomen\\'s rights in AfghanistanUnited StatesMore on this storyAfghanistan media guide27 JanuaryUN\\'s top women meet Taliban over female aid worker ban18 JanuaryTaliban use water cannon on women demonstrators24 December 2022UN denounces new Taliban restrictions on women28 December 2022Top StoriesChina looks at reforms to deepen Xi\\'s controlPublished8 hours agoHistoric ocean treaty agreed after decade of talksPublished2 hours agoInside the enclave surrounded by pro-Russia forcesPublished5 hours agoFeatures\\'The nurses wanted me to feel guilty about my abortionâ\\x80\\x99From Afghan TV fame to a US factory floorWhen is Eurovision and how do you get tickets?Do you know this baby?

But when the Taliban swept through the Afghan capital in August 2021, everything changed.\"After I wrote an article and posted it on my Facebook page, I started getting calls from the Taliban, so I went into hiding,\" she told the BBC. For weeks she was forced to move from house to house with her brother to avoid being found.Seventeen months on, Ms Joya, 24, finds herself in a very different place. Gone is the life of interviewing politicians and keeping up with the latest breaking news in Kabul. Today, home is 7,000 miles away in Dayton, Ohio.And though Ms Joya has escaped the Taliban, she still feels stuck.She spends up to 12 hours a day, six days a week working at a manufacturing plant - work, she said, that is mind-numbing and back-breaking. While Ms Joya is not required by her employer to work so many hours, she says she has little choice.Afghan interpreters fear families \\'forgotten\\' by CanadaFrom Afghanistan to Wisconsin\"I need to work to help my family,\" she said, six of whom, including her parents, live in Takhar province in north-eastern Afghanistan, which was captured by the Taliban in June 2021. \"I don\\'t like this job at all, but due to economic problems, I have to work to send money to my family, because they are in a worse situation in Afghanistan,\" she said. \"Here I can earn.\"It has been one year since the US government announced that the tens of thousands of Afghan nationals in its care following the chaotic military pull-out from Afghanistan had been resettled in host communities across the country.Image source, Supplied photoImage caption, For years, Basira Joya worked as a news broadcaster on Afghan televisionWhile dozens of highly-skilled, renowned female Afghan journalists managed to escape the country before and during the Taliban takeover, few have been able to continue their work as reporters.\"They have left their country in such a traumatising way. They have lost everything they had,\" said Zahra Nader, a Canada-based, Afghan journalist who last year founded the online newspaper Zan Times. \"And when you have worked so hard to become a journalist (in Afghanistan), you are proud of what you did. Then suddenly that is taken away from you.\"Ms Nader, who reported for the New York Times in Afghanistan and faced similar difficulties when attempting to continue her career after moving to Canada in 2017, said that since she started Zan Times, she has been inundated with requests from female journalists in exile looking for work.\"They are all professionals, and there are stories to tell,\" she said. \"But unfortunately we don\\'t have any resources to pay them.\"For Mariam Alimi, a photographer from Kabul, her favourite experiences behind the camera saw her travelling Afghanistan depicting its people and places. Working as an editorial photographer for outlets such as the Washington Post and London Times during a 15-year career, the 42-year-old said she used her camera to tell stories of Afghan women breaking barriers in business and sports at a time when the wider narrative was one of conflict and loss. \"I have shot some amazing pictures that have amazing stories behind them,\" she recalled.Today, Ms Alimi\\'s life looks quite a bit different. Having fled the Taliban takeover, she arrived in the US in October 2021, and following a stint in New Jersey, now lives in Maryland. Like Ms Joya, her journalism career has ground to a halt.\"When I came here, I saw a different picture,\" she said. \"It has not been easy to get a job that I\\'m looking for.\"Image source, Supplied photoImage caption, Photographer Mariam Alimi fled Kabul during the Taliban takeover in 2021These days, she works at a senior living community. \"I\\'m enjoying the job, keeping people happy,\" she said. \"But of course, not as much as I enjoyed my job working with my camera.\"To help reboot her career, Ms Alimi said she needs to get a driving licence and start making contacts in the photography world. She said she\\'s lucky that her family have all moved from Afghanistan and are now in the US.But in Ohio, Ms Joya\\'s lot appears decidedly more difficult. She said it has been painful to look on from afar as the Taliban banned women from attending universities and from working with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in December. All the while, she spends up to 72 hours a week working on a factory floor to support herself - at a time of near-record inflation in the US - and her family in rural Afghanistan. Her father, a police officer before the Taliban came to power, recently had to travel thousands of miles to Iran for eye surgery. \"It cost $2,000 for that surgery, so I have to help them financially because they don\\'t have any money,\" she said.Ms Joya is learning English and has not given up on her goal of continuing her journalism career. She has reached out to several Afghan news broadcasting organisations based in Washington DC and London, though none have indicated there may be a position open for her. \"It\\'s still my dream to be a journalist,\" she said.\"It\\'s still something I want to do.\"More like this:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: A teenager in Kabul expresses deep dismay at Taliban university banRelated TopicsAfghanistanWomen\\'s rights in AfghanistanUnited StatesMore on this storyAfghanistan media guide27 JanuaryUN\\'s top women meet Taliban over female aid worker ban18 JanuaryTaliban use water cannon on women demonstrators24 December 2022UN denounces new Taliban restrictions on women28 December 2022Top StoriesChina looks at reforms to deepen Xi\\'s controlPublished8 hours agoHistoric ocean treaty agreed after decade of talksPublished2 hours agoInside the enclave surrounded by pro-Russia forcesPublished5 hours agoFeatures\\'The nurses wanted me to feel guilty about my abortionâ\\x80\\x99From Afghan TV fame to a US factory floorWhen is Eurovision and how do you get tickets?Do you know this baby?

The kinetic, multiverse-spanning, family opus won numerous awards, including Best Film, Best Director and Best Editing. Comedian Hasan Minhaj hosted the star-studded event live from Santa Monica Beach, California. The annual award show honours the best in independent film and television. This year, for the first time in the award\\'s 37-year history, the best actor categories were all gender neutral. Minhaj began the night with a hilarious and at times barbed roast of the nominees and the film industry. At one point, he embarrassed actress Cate Blanchett so much she crawled under the table. Skip twitter post by Sam MeltzerThis moment from the #SpiritAwards left me in utter shock. Iâ\\x80\\x99m still not over it! pic.twitter.com/Md9DXQPHAb— Sam Meltzer (@SamTheParasite) March 4, 2023 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.End of twitter post by Sam MeltzerActor Ke Huy Quan took home the first award of the night for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Everything Everywhere. Quan, who has spent much of his career working behind the scenes, used his speech to praise the often-unsung crewmembers, from the boom operators to stunt coordinators, who make films possible. Later, Michelle Yeoh won for Best Lead Performance in the film and Stephanie Hsu took off her shoes to run onstage and accept the award for Best Breakthrough Performance. \"This is my first-ever individual award, and it feels incredibly appropriate that it\\'s in this room,\" Hsu said. It was also a big night for first-time nominees. Ayo Edebiri won Best Supporting Performance in a New Scripted Series for her role in \"The Bear.\" Actor Sheryl Lee Ralph, who was also nominated in the same category, later reflected on her how she spent much of her early career begging Hollywood to diversify. \"I stand here tonight having lost best supporting actress in television to Ayo,\" Ms Ralph said. \"I have to honestly say that\\'s what change looks like.\" Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Filmmaker Reid Davenport urged Hollywood to allow disabled artists to tell their stories.By far one of the most compelling moments of the night was when filmmaker Reid Davenport\\'s won the \"Truer than Fiction\" Award. Davenport\\'s film, I Didn\\'t See You There, charts his everyday life as someone who navigates the world in a wheelchair due to his disability. \"There are so many disabled artists trying to get into this industry who are not given a chance,\" Mr Davenport said. \"I ask you humbly to let them in. It\\'s time.\" Davenport said.

The kinetic, multiverse-spanning, family opus won numerous awards, including Best Film, Best Director and Best Editing. Comedian Hasan Minhaj hosted the star-studded event live from Santa Monica Beach, California. The annual award show honours the best in independent film and television. This year, for the first time in the award\\'s 37-year history, the best actor categories were all gender neutral. Minhaj began the night with a hilarious and at times barbed roast of the nominees and the film industry. At one point, he embarrassed actress Cate Blanchett so much she crawled under the table. Skip twitter post by Sam MeltzerThis moment from the #SpiritAwards left me in utter shock. Iâ\\x80\\x99m still not over it! pic.twitter.com/Md9DXQPHAb— Sam Meltzer (@SamTheParasite) March 4, 2023 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.End of twitter post by Sam MeltzerActor Ke Huy Quan took home the first award of the night for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Everything Everywhere. Quan, who has spent much of his career working behind the scenes, used his speech to praise the often-unsung crewmembers, from the boom operators to stunt coordinators, who make films possible. Later, Michelle Yeoh won for Best Lead Performance in the film and Stephanie Hsu took off her shoes to run onstage and accept the award for Best Breakthrough Performance. \"This is my first-ever individual award, and it feels incredibly appropriate that it\\'s in this room,\" Hsu said. It was also a big night for first-time nominees. Ayo Edebiri won Best Supporting Performance in a New Scripted Series for her role in \"The Bear.\" Actor Sheryl Lee Ralph, who was also nominated in the same category, later reflected on her how she spent much of her early career begging Hollywood to diversify. \"I stand here tonight having lost best supporting actress in television to Ayo,\" Ms Ralph said. \"I have to honestly say that\\'s what change looks like.\" Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Filmmaker Reid Davenport urged Hollywood to allow disabled artists to tell their stories.By far one of the most compelling moments of the night was when filmmaker Reid Davenport\\'s won the \"Truer than Fiction\" Award. Davenport\\'s film, I Didn\\'t See You There, charts his everyday life as someone who navigates the world in a wheelchair due to his disability. \"There are so many disabled artists trying to get into this industry who are not given a chance,\" Mr Davenport said. \"I ask you humbly to let them in. It\\'s time.\" Davenport said.
