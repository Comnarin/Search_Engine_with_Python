Where have things gone wrong? Why does France now appear so unpopular in Africa?French President Emmanuel Macron has increased aid to the continent, begun the return of cultural artefacts stolen during the colonial wars and reached out beyond the usual inter-government ties to engage younger generations and civil society.He has kept French troops in the Sahel to fight the jihadist militants that kill so many local civilians, police and soldiers and supported the regional bloc Ecowas as it tries to defend electoral politics against military takeovers.This year he flew to Rwanda to publicly acknowledge French failures during the 1994 genocide.Yet his country is now the target of embittered African complaints and criticism on a scale that is probably unprecedented. Last month, a convoy of French troops heading north to support the fight against Islamist militants was repeatedly blockaded by protesters as it crossed Burkina Faso and Niger.In September Mali\\'s Prime Minister Choguel MaÃ¯ga was met with a wave of sympathetic comment when he used a speech at the UN to accuse France of \"abandoning his country in mid-flight\", after Mr Macron began to scale back the deployment of troops in the country.Among progressive West African commentators and urban youth, it is now commonplace to hear calls for the abolition of the CFA franc - the regional currency used by many francophone countries and which is pegged to the euro under a French government guarantee. Its critics say this enables France to control the economies of those countries which use it, while France says it guarantees economic stability.Neo-colonial arroganceWhat explains this paradox? How is it that a president more concerned for Africa than most recent predecessors, and more aware too of how the continent is changing, encounters a level of French unpopularity not felt for decades?Certainly, Mr Macron\\'s self-confident - critics would say arrogant - personal style is a factor.Image source, AFPImage caption, Despite reaching out to Africa, President Macron has faced a backlashHe has made his share of diplomatic blunders.After 13 French troops died in a helicopter crash in Mali in November 2019 he demanded that West African leaders fly to France for an emergency summit, an outburst perceived as neo-colonial arrogance, particularly as Mali and Niger had suffered far heavier recent military losses. President Macron was forced into a rapid course-correction, flying to Niamey, Niger\\'s capital, to pay his respects to the NigÃ©rien military dead and postponing the summit until January 2020.But the causes of France\\'s current discomfort also extend back to decades before Mr Macron\\'s election in 2017.\"You can cite historical controversies linked to colonisation. Many of us are the children of parents who knew the colonial period and its humiliations,\" explains Ivorian political analyst Sylvain Nguessan.During the early post-independence decades, France maintained a dense web of personal connections with African leaders and elites - dubbed \"franÃ§afrique\" - which too often slid into a mutual protection of vested interests, with little regard for human rights or transparency.Among outside powers, Paris was far from alone in colluding with dictatorial allies, but its relationships were particularly close and unquestioning. Charisma and changeThe most damning failure came in Rwanda in 1994, when France failed to act even as its ally, the regime of then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, began to prepare genocide.Image source, AFPImage caption, The CFA is a colonial-era currency that is still used in several former French colonies in AfricaFrom the mid-1990s onwards several governments worked to reform France\\'s engagement with Africa and give more priority to development and democratic governance. But momentum later faltered.Nicolas Sarkozy began his tenure as president in 2007 by remarking, with a spectacular lack of tact, that \"the African man has not sufficiently entered into history\". He favoured old allies such as the Bongo family, who have governed Gabon since 1967.When FranÃ§ois Hollande became president in 2012 he had no choice but to focus on security issues in the Sahel - a swathe of land south of the Sahara desert. He never really had the political strength to revive reform efforts.But with Mr Macron\\'s accession to office, France had a president fully aware of the need for change - and with the political clout and personal enthusiasm to attack the task.In 2017 he told students in the Burkinabe capital, Ouagadougou, that France would back a reform of the CFA franc if African governments wanted this. He also invited civil society, youth and cultural figures to this year\\'s France-Africa summit in Montpellier, rather than the usual flock of presidents.Sahel - a festering woundYet his readiness to speak plainly, challenge old structures and question comfortable assumptions has not always played well, even among those who are clamouring for change.Image source, AFPImage caption, Despite France\\'s counter-terrorism operation, militants are still a major problem in the vast Sahel region of West AfricaMoreover, the situation in the Sahel has deteriorated into a festering wound. The French military presence fuels an increasingly widespread sense of grievance across West Africa.Despite a massive and sustained military effort - with more than 5,000 troops deployed and more than 50 killed - France has not been able to decisively overcome the threat from jihadists, whose attacks on local communities and security forces continue.The reasons are complex, both military and social, environmental and economic. Yet a significant proportion of local public opinion feels that France, as a high-tech Western military power, should have been able to \"sort\" the problem and should now get out of the way if it cannot do so.Those feelings seem to have motivated the protesters who blockaded the French army convoy.And this comes after earlier causes of resentments, as Mr Nguessan points out: \"The speeches of Sarkozy in Dakar, Macron in Ouagadougou the war in Ivory Coast the discouraging results of the campaign against terrorism. \"Questions related to the currency, debt, support for local dictators and ill-chosen words.\"Image source, AFPImage caption, France is still regarded as a prop for the old guard establishment - even if supporting democratic bodiesBut underlying social and communal factors also shape the attitudes of some.One senior Sahel military officer says he sees the French as allies of Tuareg former separatist rebels in northern Mali - an allegation fiercely and credibly denied in Paris.Similar complexities surround France\\'s support for West Africa regional body Ecowas - which is currently trying to pressure coup leaders in Mali and Guinea to rapidly return their countries to civilian constitutional rule. A growing number of young people regard the regional bloc as an incumbent presidents\\' club, too slow to criticise civilian rulers who manipulate democratic rules and unwilling to acknowledge the strength of popular support for military leaders promising reform.So in backing Ecowas as the legitimate African crisis management institution, France ends up being perceived as a prop for the old guard establishment.

However, in the real world of work, family and being a carer, my weekly swim feels like an achievement. We are recommended to do nearly two and a half hours (150 minutes) of moderate-intensity exercise each week. About a quarter of the population do not even manage half an hour.So is there something easier we can aim for? What is the least amount of exercise that will start to improve our health? Someone who is keen to make exercise advice less intimidating is Dr Zoe Saynor, assistant professor of clinical exercise physiology at Portsmouth University, not to mention a retired elite-level rugby player. She is going to help me look for an answer. To this end, I\\'ve been wearing an activity tracker for a week.Image caption, Dr Zoe Saynor invited me to her laboratory at the University of PortsmouthI\\'m going to get my excuses in early - it was an incredibly busy week at work, and I was tied to my desk most of the time I was wearing it. The results are still horrifying. I managed only one minute of vigorous exercise (equivalent to running) every day, and 16 minutes of moderate exercise (something like a brisk walk). \"That\\'s a picture that we see time and time again in lots of people living in modern society,\" says Dr Saynor.Whatever state my body is in, a lot is going to depend on that single hour of swimming I squeeze in most weekends. Listen to Inside Health podcast: The lazy guide to exerciseGo fast, or go far? If you want to spend less time exercising - but still achieve high results - then the only option is to work harder.\"There\\'s clear evidence that if you want to do shorter exercise sessions, they need to be of a higher intensity,\" says Dr Saynor.In official guidance, the alternative to doing 150 minutes of moderate activity is to do 75 minutes vigorously.High-intensity interval training (HIIT), involving short but very explosive bouts of activity, gets a lot of attention. However, Dr Saynor says most people cannot stick to it because HIIT requires exercising at such intense levels.What is the bare minimum?When it comes down to the least amount of exercise people should do, Dr Saynor says she is a firm believer in 5,000 to 6,000 steps a day. It is easy to scoff at advice to get off the bus one stop early, or go for a stroll on your lunch break but it does seem to make a difference. A study of nearly 80,000 people published in JAMA Internal Medicine showed that walking a bit more every day reduced the risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease or an early death. That pattern continues until you reach about 10,000 steps a day - again, faster steps are worth more than slow ones. \"If you have no time to suddenly do 10,000 steps a day, can we get you to do 5,000 steps faster? We will see an improvement in your health,\" Dr Saynor says.You do not even have to do formal exercise like going for a run, hitting the gym or swimming to see a noticeable health benefit. A study, published in Nature Medicine, looked at 25,000 people who do not \"exercise\" as such but perform small vigorous bouts of activity in day-to-day life. This could be really unextraordinary stuff - running for a train, pushing the vacuum cleaner around, playing with the kids or the dogs, carrying in the heavy shopping or taking the stairs. The research showed between three and four minutes of short vigorous activity in bursts over the day had a profound health benefit.\"The people that are displaying this intermittent activity can reduce their risk of major diseases, such as heart disease and cancer, by up to 50%,\" Mark Hamer, professor of sport and exercise medicine at University College London, tells me. \"Over the last decade, the guidelines have been slowly edging away from the message of 30 minutes a day more towards the message of \\'anything counts\\', and I think these results back up that message.\" Image source, Getty ImagesLie back in the bath - and get fit?If you still do not have time to do it, there may be another way - and it sounds much more enjoyable.How does a bath, hot tub or sauna sound?I have changed into my favourite swim shorts - a fetching pink-flamingo pair - and I am being lowered into a very warm bath. This is a precisely controlled experiment so I cannot just hop in. Researcher Thomas James has to winch me into a pool of water at 40C so only my head and neck are above water.The point of 40C is that it is higher than my core body temperature (37C), so all the time I am in here my body is working hard to lose heat. Very quickly I can feel the sweat beading on my forehead but on the rest of my body it is just being washed away and is not cooling me down. \"Hot water is actually particularly lethal in this respect,\" says Mr James.If I spent too long in here I would overheat and die of heatstroke. My heart pumps harder and more quickly as it tries to lose heat by getting blood closer to the surface of my skin. \"Your heart will be working hard, similar to what you would see with light intensity exercise,\" he says. \"We\\'re seeing reductions in blood pressure, even in healthy people.\"The big idea is to enhance exercise. \"This is a really good way of mimicking some of those benefits you get from exercise but the evidence is certainly pretty clear that exercise is best and then the two together get the biggest health benefits,\" says Mr James, adding: \"I think this will really play a big part in the future.\"So if you go to the gym and then hit the sauna or a hot tub afterwards you might get a cheeky boost. However, the team at Portsmouth caution people to stick to the recommendations. \"Don\\'t go, \\'I\\'m going to stay in here as long as I can.\\' Do it for enjoyment,\" says Mr James.The advice is often between 10 and 20 minutes depending on exactly what facilities you are using, so do check. Obviously all of us should be aiming to do the recommended amount of exercise but, given that many of us find that impossible, it is hugely reassuring that there are significant benefits to be had just by doing a little bit more than we are already.Inside Health was produced by Erika Wright.
