The Pentagon said Abdul Rabbani operated an al-Qaeda safe house, while his brother organised travel and funds for the group\\'s leaders.The brothers alleged that they were tortured by CIA officers, before being transferred to Guantanamo.Both have now been repatriated to Pakistan.The Guantanamo camp, based in Cuba, was established by then-President George W Bush in 2002 to house foreign terrorism suspects following the 9/11 terror attacks in New York. It is based within a US Navy base.But the camp has come to symbolise some of the excesses of the \"war on terror\" due to interrogation methods that critics say amount to torture, and detainees being held for long periods without trial. US President Joe Biden says he hopes to close the facility, where 32 people are still being detained. At its peak in 2003 the facility held 680 prisoners at one time. \"The United States appreciates the willingness of the Government of Pakistan and other partners to support ongoing US efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility,\" the Pentagon said in a statement.The brothers were captured by Pakistan\\'s security services in the city of Karachi in September 2002. It took almost two years for them to be transferred to Guantanamo after originally being held at a CIA detention facility in Afghanistan.Both men were approved for release in 2021. it is unclear why they remained imprisoned. The sudden silencing of Guantanamo\\'s artistsAhmed Rabbani\\'s wife was pregnant at the time of his arrest and just five months later she gave birth to their son. He has never met his son. During his time at Guantanamo, Ahmed Rabbani built a name for himself as an accomplished artist. Maya Foa, director of justice charity Reprieve, which provided legal representation to Ahmed Rabbani until last year, called his two decades of imprisonment a \"tragedy\" that \"exemplifies how far the USA strayed from its founding principles during the \\'war on terror\\' era\".\"They robbed a family of a son, a husband and a father. That injustice can never be rectified. A full reckoning of the harms caused by the disastrous \\'war on terror\\' can only begin when GuantÃ¡namo is closed for good,\" she said.

But India has resisted the pressure and continued with its strategy of not criticising Russia directly. It has abstained from similar resolutions both at the UNGA and at the UNSC in the past. The two countries have a decades-old trusted relationship since the Cold War. Russia is also India\\'s largest arms supplier even though its share has dropped in recent years largely due to Delhi\\'s decision to boost domestic defence manufacturing and a widening imports portfolio.The two countries also have a history of diplomatic co-operation - Moscow has vetoed UNSC resolutions over the disputed region of Kashmir.Delhi, however, has talked about the importance of \"the UN Charter, international law, and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states\" in its past statements on Ukraine. At the UN vote on Friday, India\\'s permanent representative to the UN, Ruchira Kamboj, said \"no solution can ever arrive at the cost of human lives\".Excerpts from PR @ruchirakambojâ\\x80\\x99s explanation of vote at the #UNGA Emergency Special Session on #Ukraine today. pic.twitter.com/tUptpHj09j— India at UN, NY (@IndiaUNNewYork) February 24, 2023 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterThe UN motion in New York called for immediate peace and reaffirmed support for Ukraine\\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity, rejecting any Russian claims to the parts of the country it occupies. In September, MPs in Moscow voted to illegally annex four regions of Ukraine.The UN also demanded \"that the Russian Federation immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders\" and called for a cessation of hostilities.Besides India, China, Iran and South Africa were among the 32 countries to abstain in the vote.The seven countries who voted against it were Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, Mali, Nicaragua and Syria.Read more India stories from the BBC:India-Pakistan online love story that ended in jailIndia\\'s tennis icon who showed hate could be defeatedMPs call BBC India office searches \\'intimidation\\' Pay cut shock for new hires at India IT giantBjorn Borg leaves India event as minister runs lateAnger over parole for Indian guru jailed for rapeRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warAsiaRussiaUnited NationsIndiaUkraineMore on this storyUN condemns Russian invasion ahead of anniversary18 hours agoTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

So why are some now deciding to return?Kim Hyung-deok met his wife at South Korea\\'s top university, has two children and a successful career. He has a house in the countryside outside Seoul and a taste for sharp suits.Hyung-deok was born in North Korea, but about 20 years ago escaped to the South. He is one of about 25,000 to do so in the past two decades.It is a long and dangerous journey, but once defectors arrive South Korean citizenship is guaranteed.Yet a small number, Hyung-deok among them, are intent on returning to their repressive homeland. Family separations\"It might look as if I\\'ve succeeded in South Korea,\" Hyung-deok says, \"but I haven\\'t really, because my parents and siblings are still in the North, and I haven\\'t been able to see them.\"It\\'s only natural for me to try to find ways to visit North Korea - openly and legally.\"A few years ago, Hyung-deok travelled to the North Korean embassy in China and said he wanted to go back for a \"holiday\". \"At the time, relations between the two Koreas were quite good, and South Koreans were able to visit North Korea,\" he says.Image caption, Kim Hyung-deok escaped to South Korea 20 years ago\"Yet no-one who actually came from the North had tried to do it - I was the first. When they learned that I was a defector, they got very angry.\"Hyung-deok says that he is planning another attempt to enter North Korea next year.It is illegal for South Korean citizens, including defectors, to have any direct contact with the North - no phone calls, no emails, no letters.Defectors with family left behind often push for warmer relations between the two governments, in the hope of seeing them again.River crossingBecause of the tightly-patrolled frontier between the two Koreas, most fugitives from the North escape across the river border with China. That\\'s also where Kim Gwang-ho arrived, 18 months ago, but to re-defect to North Korea.Gwang-ho had left South Korea after getting into financial difficulty. His plan was to swim across the river, but he had his wife and child with him and decided the current was too strong.So instead he visited the North Korean consulate. It took him a week to persuade them he was serious.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, A defector describes life in a North Korean prison campGwang-ho and his family were taken to Pyongyang and paraded in front of a press conference organised by the regime.He said people who escaped to South Korea were the \"victims of human rights activists, conspiring against the North Korean state\".South Korean government figures state that 13 defectors have returned to the North since they started arriving in the South 20 years ago, but activists say many more have re-defected unofficially. There are questions over whether the North Korean state has a role in forcing people to return, and defectors in the South fear what sort of information might be passed on by those going back.For Gwang-ho, initially it seemed life in the South was a distant memory - its capitalist democracy reviled and criticised. But a few months later, he decided he wanted to go back. \\'Desperate story\\'However, once there, he was hauled in front of a South Korean judge and asked about his erratic behaviour.His lawyer cited financial problems in the North. Other reports suggest he feared for his safety. The court jailed him for three years for \"entering North Korea and revealing classified information about other defectors, and about South Korea\\'s methods of investigation\".The BBC was denied permission to visit Gwang-ho.We wrote to him instead and, in his reply, he explained that the press conferences arranged by North Korea to showcase returned defectors are compulsory. This is my \"real and desperate story\", he wrote. Finding a place in South Korean society is not easy for defectors.Image source, United NationsImage caption, Inmates\\' drawings have captured scenes from North Korean prison campsUnemployment among them is more than three times the national average. Some surveys suggest more than half experience depression, and that 25-30% of young defectors have considered leaving South Korea because they feel they don\\'t fit in.Like other defectors, Son Jung-hun got a package of government support on arrival in South Korea, including a flat. But debt problems have meant bailiffs have taken his fridge and washing machine. Now, his meagre food rations are stored on the unheated balcony.Jung-hun has appealed to the South Korean government for official permission to return home. \\'Eating rats\\'\"Over the years I\\'ve noticed the political indifference towards defectors here in the South,\" he tells me. \"There have been days when I ask myself why I chose to come here in the first place. Anywhere a North Korean defector goes, he could face difficulties and discrimination.\"But, for every defector returning home, many thousands more have no intention of ever going back, saying they suffered harsh punishment and repression in their homeland.One North Korean defector I met fled to Seoul a year ago, after she was released from imprisonment at North Korea\\'s prison camp Number 12. She had been held after exchanging some foreign currency with a Japanese national and accused of espionage.The woman describes seeing large maggots crawling around the camp that had grown out of corpses.\"People would dash for them, grab them and put them in their pockets. Later, they would eat them,\" she says.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch Lucy Williamson\\'s Newsnight film on the North Korean defectors longing for home\"Others would capture rats and eat them raw. I remember their mouths covered in blood. I saw so many people killed for breaking very minor rules. In my cell alone, three people were killed within a month.\"UN investigators recently found \"abundant evidence of crimes against humanity\" committed by the regime, and said North Korea should face international justice. North Korea denies allegations of torture made by defectors, and the existence of prison camps, and refused to allow UN investigators access to the country to gather evidence.When the first defector from the North arrived in South Korea 20 years ago, there were huge celebrations, and huge expectations.Both governments talk about the need for reunification, but the lesson provided by South Korea\\'s defectors is stark - if integrating 20,000 North Koreans is so difficult, what will happen when it\\'s time to absorb 20 million of them?More on this storyN Korea demands return of defectors22 November 2013S Korea kills man swimming to North16 September 2013Life after North Korea23 April 2013The terrible price of a Korean defection25 April 2012Life inside the North Korean bubble1 June 2010Top StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

Beneath his green helmet, dark shadows ringed his eyes. He had been on his feet all night fighting. Like many on Ukraine\\'s eastern front, he is both battle-hardened and war-weary.\"It\\'s difficult. People don\\'t get enough sleep. They are standing for 20 hours. The fight goes on around the clock. I can\\'t say more, it\\'s secret. But, we can\\'t go back.\"His unit, from the Ukraine\\'s 35th Brigade, is part of the defence of Vuhledar. The name means gift of coal, and this prosperous mining town was once home to 15,000 people. But now it\\'s a wasteland - one of many on Ukraine\\'s 1,300 kilometre (807 mile) front line. Blackened apartment blocks tower over deserted streets. A church has been reduced to a shell - its roof peeled off and windows shattered. A cross still stands at the front, punctured by shrapnel. In the playground, there are bullet holes in the slide. Vuhledar\\'s children are long gone. The town sits on high ground in the heavily contested Donbas region in the east. From here Ukraine can target rail lines used by the Russians for resupply. It needs to hold this bastion. Moscow needs to take it. Some of the fiercest fighting of recent months has been here.\"The front line is one kilometre away,\" said the commander, having to repeat himself over the rattle of heavy machine-gun fire, this time outgoing. \"They are pushing, and we lack armour. We are waiting for the Lend-Lease [the US programme that provides military equipment] and we will advance.\" That\\'s a familiar refrain on front lines here as Ukraine awaits Western battle tanks promised by its allies.Image source, Goktay Koraltan/BBCImage caption, The commander, codenamed Beast, says Ukraine\\'s forces are waiting for Western weapons before advancingFor now, the defenders of Vuhledar use what they have got.A few troops dart into position, to target the enemy. They lob mortars - and obscenities - then make a quick getaway, to avoid being targeted themselves.We move forward carefully to within 500 metres of the front line. The Russians have no line of sight. We are shielded by buildings. But suddenly there\\'s a warning shout. We have to take cover at a wall. The troops have heard something overhead, possibly a Russian drone. That\\'s our cue to pull back.The Russians may have eyes in the sky here - and superior firepower - but critics back home are questioning their vision.A hapless Russian attempt to take the town earlier this month ended in heavy losses and humiliation. A column of tanks and armoured vehicles headed straight for Ukrainian positions - through minefields - in full view on a flat plain. Ukraine stopped them in their tracks, much as it stopped an armoured column approaching Kyiv last year. If the Russians learned anything from that, it didn\\'t show in Vuhledar.About 300 souls remain in this broken town without heat or light - frozen in place by age, clinging to their memories. Solace comes in the form of Oleh Tkachenko, a jovial evangelical pastor in combat gear, who brings aid here twice a week. Image source, Goktay Koraltan/BBCImage caption, Pastor Oleh (right) gives out food and hugs on aid trips to VuhledarHe arrives in the early morning, before the shelling reaches its peak. Soon his armoured van attracts a queue of men and women bundled up in winter coats and hats. \"Hang on,\" he says, as hands reach out for freshly baked bread. \"It\\'s one loaf for each person.\"Valentina, who is 73, quietly waits her turn. She\\'s a slight figure, bent low over a walking stick, with a head torch around her neck. She tells us she has nowhere else to go.\"We are frightened, of course,\" she says. \"But what can we do? We live with it. You can\\'t say \\'Don\\'t shoot!\\' They have their job. We have our lives.\" She recalls life before the invasion. \"The town was quiet, calm, and clean. People worked and had money. What can I say? It was a good town.\" Her voice cracks and she falls silent.Image source, Goktay Koraltan/BBCImage caption, Valentina is one of just 300 residents remaining in the embattled townAt the van Pastor Oleh dispenses some advice, and a quick hug before hurrying people away. Crowds are a target.\"There\\'s always shelling,\" he says. \"We try not to gather a lot of people. We park carefully, in the safest places, near the entrance to a building where people can take shelter. We help because it\\'s a matter of life or death. The risk is huge but so is the reward - saving people\\'s lives.\" He\\'s pained by the fate of Vuhledar, which was his home for three years. \"I think it\\'s completely obvious that Russia hates Ukraine,\" he says. \"It hates our cities and our people, and it is destroying everything it hates. No matter what Russia says, its action scream louder than its words.\"The story of Vuhledar is replicated in many parts of the eastern front. Ukraine is resisting, straining every sinew. The Russians are not winning but they aren\\'t giving up either.There is a cold hard truth on the front lines here. One year after his invasion, President Putin stills holds almost a fifth of this vast country. Both sides have signalled that major offensives are coming. The coming months will be critical.

The person he helped was his wife.Mulayam Singh Yadav, 21, from India and Iqra Jeewani, 19, from Pakistan met and fell in love online three years ago, while playing the board game Ludo. But they knew it would be hard for them to be together. India and Pakistan share a fraught relationship - the neighbours have fought three wars since 1947, when India was partitioned on independence and Pakistan created. This can make it hard for people to get visas to travel to see each other.So last September, Mulayam and Iqra travelled to Nepal, where they got married. They then travelled to the Indian city of Bangalore (Bengaluru) - the capital of Karnataka state - and lived together.But their happy life turned tragic in January - Ms Jeewani was detained for entering India illegally while Mr Yadav was arrested and charged with fraud, forgery and providing shelter to a foreign national without proper documents.She was deported to Pakistan last week, while Mr Yadav remains in jail in Bangalore. Mr Yadav\\'s family members, who live in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, are devastated by the arrests. They say the couple\\'s story is simply one of love.\"We want them home,\" says his brother Jeetlal. \"We understand the situation between India and Pakistan. But all they did was fall in love.\"Even the police seem to agree. \"Besides the illegal entry and forgery, it seems to be a love story,\" a senior Bangalore police official said on condition of anonymityImage source, Jeet Lal YadavImage caption, The couple got married in Nepal last year but their time together was shortThat love story began in 2020, during the Covid lockdown. Mr Yadav worked as a security guard for an IT company in Bangalore while Ms Jeewani was a student in Pakistan\\'s Hyderabad city.The two began a long-distance relationship after meeting online. But Ms Jeewani was under increasing pressure from her family to get married.On Mr Yadav\\'s suggestion, she left Pakistan and travelled to Nepal via Dubai to meet him. Police say the two got married in a Hindu ceremony in a temple there and came to India.But Ms Jeewani did not have the documents required to stay in India, so police say Mr Yadav arranged a fake Aadhaar card - an Indian identity document - for her.According to the police, Mr Yadav would go out every day to work while Ms Jeewani stayed at home.But she frequently made WhatsApp calls to her mother back home in Pakistan, which led the police to her.Bangalore police officials say they were on high alert last month because two major international events were due to take place in the city in February: the Aero India air show and a G20 finance ministers\\' meeting.After further investigation, Ms Jeewani was detained for illegal entry and handed over to the Foreigners Regional Registration Office on 20 January. She was deported to Pakistan in February.\"As of now, there is no offence made out against her other than just coming into the country illegally,\" S Girish, deputy police commissioner in Bangalore\\'s Whitefield district, told the BBC. \"But the investigation is ongoing.\"The BBC could not reach Ms Jeewani or her family in Pakistan for comment. Earlier this week, PTI news agency reported that her father had confirmed that she had reached home, and that they did not want to \"speak on this issue\".Mr Yadav\\'s mother Shanti Devi says she hopes the governments of both countries can help reunite them.\"We don\\'t care if she\\'s Muslim or Pakistani, she\\'s our daughter-in-law.

On 24 February 2022, the Kremlin captain set sail in a storm of his own making. And headed straight for the iceberg. Vladimir Putin\\'s invasion of Ukraine has brought death and destruction to Russia\\'s neighbour. It has resulted in huge military casualties for his own country: some estimates put the number of dead Russian soldiers in the tens of thousands. Hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens have been drafted into the army and Russian prisoners (including convicted killers) have been recruited to fight in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the war has impacted energy and food prices around the world and continues to threaten European and global security. All problems of Titanic proportions.So why did Russia\\'s president set a course for war and territorial conquest? Image source, EPAImage caption, Mr Putin attended a military ceremony on Thursday to mark Defender of the Fatherland Day\"On the horizon were the Russian presidential elections of 2024,\" points out political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann. \"Two years before that vote [the Kremlin] wanted some victorious event. In 2022 they would achieve their objectives. In 2023 they would instil in the minds of Russians how fortunate they were to have such a captain steering the ship, not just through troubled waters, but bringing them to new and richer shores. Then in 2024 people would vote. Bingo. What could go wrong?\" Plenty, if your plans are based on misassumptions and miscalculations. The Kremlin had expected its \"special military operation\" to be lightning fast. Within weeks, it thought, Ukraine would be back in Russia\\'s orbit. President Putin had seriously underestimated Ukraine\\'s capacity to resist and fight back, as well as the determination of Western nations to support Kyiv.Russia\\'s leader has yet to acknowledge, though, that he made a mistake by invading Ukraine. Mr Putin\\'s way is to push on, to escalate, to raise the stakes.Which brings me on to two key questions: how does Vladimir Putin view the situation one year on and what will be his next move in Ukraine?This week he gave us some clues. His state-of-the-nation address was packed with anti-Western bile. He continues to blame America and Nato for the war in Ukraine, and to portray Russia as an innocent party. His decision to suspend participation in the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and America, New Start, shows that President Putin has no intention of pulling back from Ukraine or ending his standoff with the West.The following day, at a Moscow football stadium, Mr Putin shared the stage with Russian soldiers back from the front line. At what was a highly choreographed pro-Kremlin rally, President Putin told the crowd that \"there are battles going on right now on [Russia\\'s] historical frontiers\" and praised Russia\\'s \"courageous warriors\". Conclusion: don\\'t expect any Kremlin U-turns. This Russian president is not for turning.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds\"If he faces no resistance, he will go as far as can,\" believes Andrei Illarionov, President Putin\\'s former economic adviser. \"There is no other way to stop him other than military resistance.\"But what about talks over tanks? Is negotiating peace with Mr Putin possible? \"It\\'s possible to sit down with anyone,\" Andrei Illarionov continues, \"but we have an historic record of sitting down with Putin and making agreements with him. \"Putin violated all the documents. The agreement on the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the bilateral treaty between Russia and Ukraine, the treaty on the internationally recognised border of Russia and Ukraine, the UN charter, the Helsinki Act of 1975, the Budapest Memorandum. And so on. There is no document he would not violate.\"When it comes to breaking agreements, the Russian authorities have a long list of their own grudges to level at the West. Topping that list is Moscow\\'s assertion that the West broke a promise it made in the 1990s not to enlarge the Nato alliance eastwards. And yet in his early years in office, Vladimir Putin appeared not to view Nato as a threat. In 2000 he even did not exclude Russia one day becoming a member of the Alliance. Two years later, asked to comment on Ukraine\\'s stated intention of joining Nato, President Putin replied: \"Ukraine is a sovereign state and is entitled to choose itself how to ensure its own securityâ\\x80¦\" He insisted the issue would not cloud relations between Moscow and Kyiv.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, On Tuesday the Russian president delivered his annual state-of-the-nation addressPutin circa 2023 is a very different character. Seething with resentment at the \"collective West\", he styles himself as leader of a besieged fortress, repelling the alleged attempts of Russia\\'s enemies to destroy his country. From his speeches and comments - and his references to imperial Russian rulers like Peter the Great and Catherine the Great - Mr Putin appears to believe he is destined to recreate the Russian empire in some shape or form.But at what cost to Russia? President Putin once earned himself a reputation for bringing stability to his country. That has disappeared amid rising military casualties, mobilisation and economic sanctions. Several hundred thousand Russians have left the country since the start of the war, many of them young, skilled and educated: a brain drain that will hurt Russia\\'s economy even more. As a result of the war, suddenly, there are a lot of groups around with guns, including private military companies, like Yevgeny Prigozhin\\'s Wagner group and regional battalions. Relations with the regular armed forces are far from harmonious. The conflict between Russia\\'s Ministry of Defence and Wagner is an example of public infighting within the elites. Instability plus private armies is a dangerous cocktail. \"Civil war is likely to cover Russia for the next decade,\" believes Konstantin Remchukov, owner and editor of Moscow-based newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta. \"There are too many interest groups who understand that in these conditions there\\'s a chance to redistribute wealth.\"\"The real chance to avoid civil war will be if the right person comes to power immediately after Putin. A person who has authority over the elites and the resoluteness to isolate those eager to exploit the situation.\"Image caption, Newspaper editor Konstantin Remchukov fears Russia is facing civil war\"Are the Russian elites discussing who the right man or woman is?\" I ask Konstantin.\"Quietly. With the lights off. They do discuss this. They will have their voice.\"\"And does Putin know these discussions are happening?\"\"He knows. I think he knows everything.\"This week the speaker of the lower house of Russia\\'s parliament declared: \"As long as there\\'s Putin, there\\'s Russia.\" It was a statement of loyalty, but not of fact. Russia will survive - it has managed to for centuries. Vladimir Putin\\'s fate, however, is linked irrevocably now to the outcome of the war in Ukraine.

We\\'ve looked into some of his statements. \\'The neo-Nazi regime that set up in Ukraine after 2014\\'Mr Putin has repeatedly made baseless claims about a \"neo-Nazi regime\" in Ukraine as a justification for Russia\\'s invasion of the country. In Ukraine\\'s last parliamentary election in 2019, support for far-right candidates was 2%, far lower than in many other European countries.It should also be noted that President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish and members of his family died in the Holocaust.But there have been far-right groups in Ukraine - the most high-profile is the Azov regiment - elements of which have expressed support for Nazi ideology.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, From 2022: Ros Atkins on... Putinâ\\x80\\x99s false Nazi claims about UkraineIt was formed to resist Russian-backed separatists, who seized areas of eastern Ukraine in 2014, and was subsequently absorbed as a unit within the Ukrainian military.\\'One of the brigades of the Ukrainian armed forces... was awarded the name Edelweiss, like the Hitler division\\'Here, Mr Putin drew a comparison between a Ukrainian army unit and the Nazis\\' 1st Mountain Division - which had the Edelweiss flower on its insignia and committed war crimes in the Second World War. On 14 February, President Zelensky gave the 10th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade the honorary title: Edelweiss. The next day, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs highlighted this as \"evidence\" of Nazis in Ukraine in a tweet. But the Edelweiss flower - which grows in Alpine regions - has been used as a symbol by other European mountain military divisions, including the Croatian Mountain Rescue Service, Swiss Army generals and the 21st Rifles Brigade of Poland. Even Russia had a special unit called Edelweiss. The 17th special purpose detachment of Rosgvardia was given this title in 2011. The name was changed to Avanguard in 2016.\\'We also remember the attempts of the Kyiv regime to acquire nuclear weapons, because they talked about it publicly\\'There is no evidence that Ukraine has attempted to acquire nuclear weapons, and Mr Putin - who has made this claim before - did not provide any. When it was part of the former Soviet Union, nuclear weapons were based in Ukraine, but in 1994 Ukraine signed up to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and gave them up, in return for security guarantees. In 2021, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, suggested that if Ukraine couldn\\'t join Nato, it might have to reconsider its nuclear-free status.In 2022, President Zelensky said that although Ukraine had \"abandoned\" its nuclear capabilities, it had \"no security\". But the Ukrainian government has not expressed an intention to acquire nuclear weapons and a military strategy document published in 2021 did not refer to them.The UN\\'s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says it has seen no signs in Ukraine \"of the diversion of nuclear material, intended for peaceful activities, for other purposes.\"Putin\\'s Ukraine statement fact-checkedPutin\\'s Victory Day speech fact-checkedFact-checking Russia\\'s biological weapons claims\\'GDP in 2022 has decreased by only 2.1% and I\\'ll remind you that in February or March they predicted a collapse of the Russian economy\\'Mr Putin is right that the Russian economy has shrunk by less than expected. Russia\\'s statistics agency says the economy measured by GDP contracted by 2.1%, which is close to the 2.2% estimate in the latest report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).That contraction still makes it the worst-performing country on the IMF\\'s list, but the organisation confirms that it has contracted by less than expected.The IMF said that Russian trade was being redirected to countries not applying sanctions against it.India and China have become the largest buyers of Russian oil, for example, as Western nations restrict purchases and impose sanctions.In July 2022, the IMF was predicting a 6% contraction in Russian GDP for the year.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaReality CheckVladimir PutinUkraineTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

The satellite images showed \"very early signs of activity\" which took place only in the last few days, including construction of a new building, repair of an existing one, and lumber and sawdust at Punggye-Ri, according to a report by analysts from the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS). The pictures were taken on Friday by satellite imaging company Maxar.The work indicates that North Korea \"has made some decision about the status of the test site\", the analysts said.One possibility could be a plan to bring the test site back to a state of readiness to resume nuclear explosive testing. The move would align with an earlier statement issued by North Korea in January to \"examine the issue of restarting all temporarily-suspended activities,\" they said. But the analysts called the new activity spotted at Punggye-ri \"preliminary\", pointing out it could take \"months, if not years, from being ready for North Korea to conduct nuclear explosions\". They added that this would depend on the extent of the damage inflicted to the site\\'s tunnels when it was closed down.Another possibility, they said, was that North Korea may resume nuclear testing at another location.Punggye-ri, located in the north-east of the country, was declared shut and allegedly dismantled in 2018, in what was seen as part of a diplomatic rapprochement with South Korea and the US. International media were invited to witness a series of explosions which Pyongyang claimed would block tunnels and entrances, but officials refused to allow international inspectors to enter. Some worried at the time that the damage caused could be easily reversible.Punggye-ri is believed to be North Korea\\'s main nuclear facility, and up until 2018 was the only active nuclear testing site in the world. North Korea has conducted six known nuclear tests since 2006 at the facility. In August, the International Atomic Energy Agency said the North was appearing to re-start its Yongbyon nuclear reactor, raising concerns that plutonium for nuclear weapons was being produced at the reactor\\'s complex.

Voters are set to elect a new president after eight years under Muhammadu Buhari but whoever wins will face some tough challenges. Here, in charts, are some of the things on the minds of those about to cast their ballots.In the last year, Nigerians - like people around the world - have been hit by rising food prices caused by the fallout from the conflict in Ukraine. But prices had been going up before the fighting began - caused by the closure of the border to many imports and a scarcity of foreign exchange. Overall, inflation in 2022 stood at just under 19%, the highest in two decades. The staple food, garri - cassava flakes - has been one of the least affected of the basic goods, but the large jump in the price of other essentials such as tomatoes and vegetable oil is having a big impact on families.If the new president wants to help people with the cost of basic items, they will face the problem that the government is already spending more than it receives. Huge sums are spent on subsidising petrol and the oil-producing nation has not been able to take advantage of higher oil prices as it has little refining capacity and has to re-import petrol. Analysts are getting increasingly concerned about the sustainability of the public debt with the cost of paying the interest on it exceeding government income at times in 2022.As one of Africa's top oil producers, Nigeria has relied on the black gold for government revenue as well as a source of vital foreign currency. Nevertheless, the oil-rich country has not taken advantage of the money generated - much of it has been stolen or misused.And oil production has been declining in the last decade. In 2022 it fell to its lowest level in 30 years.Oil theft and vandalism have been blamed for the loss of output. This, added to years of under-investment and the age of the oil fields themselves, means that Nigeria is falling behind other oil-producing nations.With half of Nigerians under the age of 18, the country's leaders face the challenge of how to harness this youthful population.They need to help the economy grow to fulfil the needs and ambitions of all those young people.Even with so many people too young to cast their ballots, 40% of registered voters are under the age of 35, making them a huge constituency. A direct appeal to them could influence the outcome of the election.The first thing that most young Nigerians want is a job.Currently a third of Nigerians who want to work are unemployed. When it comes to young people, more than half of those between 15 and 24 are looking for work.The measures to deal with the Covid pandemic certainly had an impact but unemployment rates were rising before the outbreak of the virus.The economy has grown since 2015, but just not fast enough to accommodate all the new people seeking jobs.Insecurity has been cited as one of the reasons behind low growth, but economists have also blamed other measures such as currency restrictions and shutting the borders to many imports, saying they discourage investment.The level of access to some basic infrastructure that could improve the ease of doing business, as well as everyday lives, is low.The poor state of the power network has long been a source of criticism and only around 55% of the population have access to electricity, according to World Bank figures.And when it comes to the internet, just 36% of Nigerians are getting online, which puts it in the middle of the pack of West African countries.Dealing with the growing levels of violence in Nigeria will be a major priority for the next president.When President Buhari was first elected in 2015, the threat from militant Islamist group Boko Haram in the north-east was the biggest concern. While they no longer control much territory, upsurges in kidnappings, politically motivated attacks, farmer-herder tensions, criminal violence and a separatist insurgency in the south-east, as well as police brutality, undermine faith in the state to keep the population safe.This is no longer an issue that is largely confined to the north-east - the problem has now spread across the country. Your device may not support this visualisation Of all the children around the world who don't go to school, one in five live in Nigeria. While this is partly a reflection of the sheer size of the country's young population, the fact that nearly 40% of the country's 5-11-year-olds are not in school is a major concern.This is a countrywide issue but attendance levels are generally worse in the north. Some of this has been affected by insecurity, but gender and poverty are also factors.

The very same morning in Bucha, just outside Kyiv, 67-year-old Volodymyr Scherbynyn was standing outside his local supermarket when more than a hundred Russian military vehicles rolled into town. Both Volodymyr and the satellite were witnesses to a key part of President Vladimir Putin\\'s plan for a quick and overwhelming victory. They were also witnesses to its failure.The western media called it a convoy. In reality, it was a traffic jam and a major tactical blunder. Forty-eight hours after that first satellite photograph, on 28 February 2022, the line of vehicles had grown to a colossal 35 miles (56 km) long. The vehicles were stalled for weeks. Then finally they retreated, and seemingly disappeared overnight. What happened? Why did such a massive force fail to reach Kyiv?A BBC team spoke to dozens of witnesses including military personnel, national and international intelligence services, civilians, veterans, and the territorial defence, all of whom came into contact with the convoy. It also gained access to Russian maps and documents that shed light on what the plan actually was, and why it went so spectacularly wrong.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Satellite images of the convoy captured last year Â© 2022 Maxar TechnologiesThe first hoursThe story starts on the first day of the war, in the north of Ukraine at its border with Belarus.Stepping outside for his first cigarette of the day, 23-year-old Vladyslav from Ukraine\\'s 80th Air Assault Brigade saw a flurry of bright lights in the night sky. \"I remember watching the lights emerge from the whole forest. At first I thought they were car headlights. But then I realised they were Grads [self-propelled multiple missile launchers]. They were firing at us.\" Camped deep within the forest of the Chernobyl exclusion zone, Vladyslav\\'s unit was on patrol when the first Russian vehicles crossed into Ukraine.\"The whole earth was shaking. Have you ever been in a tank? There\\'s no other sound like it. It\\'s a powerful thing.\"As planned in the event of any attack, Vladyslav and the rest of the 80th brigade blew up the bridge connecting Chernobyl to the next big town, Ivankiv.The Russians would be forced to waste time building a replacement pontoon bridge, giving Vladyslav and his unit time to pull back to Kyiv. \"At first I was surprised, why didn\\'t we stop them there in Chernobyl? But we needed to learn about our enemy. So that\\'s what we did.\" This close to the Belarus border, the Ukrainians could not afford to open fire and risk starting another conflict. Their priority was to first understand Russia\\'s battle plan, before sending their troops into the line of fire. Putin\\'s master planWhat Vladyslav saw were the first vehicles of what would become the convoy.Contrary to many media reports at the time, the 35 mile-long (56 km) column was in fact 10 separate Russian tactical battalion units, according to the Ukrainian Armed Forces.The Russian army also attacked Ukraine in the east and south, but the mission for these 10 units was specific - enter Ukraine from Belarus, overthrow Ukraine\\'s capital city and remove the government. In military terms: a decapitation attack.One Russian document, seen by the BBC, shows a timetable for the plan. After the first battalion crossed into Ukraine at 04:00 am on 24 February, their orders were to advance straight to Kyiv arriving by 14:55. Several of the battalions were to advance to Hostomel, just north of Kyiv, to back up the troops who\\'d been airlifted in to secure the airport.The rest were to head straight into the centre of Kyiv. Image source, BBC / Claire Jude PressImage caption, Luibov Demydiv (R), a pensioner from Demydiv, points on the map to where she saw the convoy circling after a bridge was destroyed, stopping their advanceThe assault heavily relied on two elements - secrecy and speed.According to the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) (a UK-based security think tank) by keeping plans about an attack on the capital under wraps, Russian soldiers could outnumber the Ukrainian forces by 12 to one in the north of Kyiv.However, Putin\\'s secrecy came at a cost. So successful was his deception, even most of his commanders did not receive their orders until 24 hours before the invasion. On a tactical level, this left them vulnerable. They lacked food, fuel and maps. They were without proper communication tools. They had insufficient ammunition. They were even ill-prepared for the winter weather.Kitted out with the wrong tyres and surrounded by snow, the Russians drove straight into a mud bath. Civilians close to Ivankiv describe Russian soldiers telling Ukrainian farmers to help pull their tanks out of the sludge. How war is seen in rural RussiaHas Putin\\'s war in Ukraine failed?Ukraine war: President Putin speech fact-checkedUnable to progress, the Russian vehicles needed to divert to paved roads in order to avoid soft ground, forcing thousands to group into a single column. But with limited communication between the battalions, they almost immediately converged into one almighty traffic jam. As one military expert on the ground put it: \"You don\\'t ever travel into hostile territory in a long convoy. Ever.\"Based on witness testimony and intelligence from the Ukrainian military, we were able to map the ground the convoy covered in the time between the outbreak of war and the end of March. By avoiding travelling across fields, vehicles ended up on most of the main roads north of Kyiv.By the time the column had grown as long as 35 miles (56 km) it included up to 1,000 tanks, 2,400 mechanised infantry vehicles and 10,000 personnel, as well as dozens of supply trucks carrying food, fuel, oil and ammunition. Stalled north of Kyiv and running out of food and fuel, the Russians had also underestimated their adversary. A united resistanceFor three days Volodymyr Scherbynyn and his fellow volunteers, the majority of them pensioners, had been preparing for the arrival of the convoy in their hometown of Bucha.Armed with one machine gun between the 12 of them, they took down all the road signs, built checkpoints, and prepared hundreds of petrol bombs.Until finally, on Sunday morning the Russian tanks rolled into town. Image source, BBC / Claire Jude PressImage caption, Maksym (L) Volodymyr (C) and \\'\"the colonel\" (R) stand in front of their bombed out office for local volunteersFor nearly 30 minutes, Volodymyr and his grassroots unit battered the tanks with what little they had.\"We set two of the vehicles on fire and slowed down the whole convoy,\" says Volodymyr.But then came the retaliation. \"When they saw us throwing bottles they opened fire,\" says 30-year-old Maksym Shkoropar. \"I was a barman. I didn\\'t have any military training.\"By the end of that half hour, every one of Volodymyr\\'s party had been shot and evacuated to hospital.But even from the sick bay, Volodymyr kept on fighting - receiving and cross-checking sightings of the convoy from civilians all over the Kyiv region and calling them in to the Ukrainian authorities.On the other end of the line was 23-year-old local deputy governor for Irpin, Roman Pohorily. Image source, BBC / Claire Jude PressImage caption, Lawyer and councillor by day, Roman searches for Russian posts on social media by night.He tells the BBC he didn\\'t sleep for three days.\"My colleague and I were manning the hotline at the council office, taking calls about the column, as well as saboteurs - people who were painting marks on the ground for the convoy to follow.\"A councillor by day, Roman is also an open source intelligence expert by night. Co-founder of the highly regarded website DeepState, he pools together social media and intelligence reports. He geolocates them, then reposts them on his website. \"On their way to Kyiv, the Russians were posting videos on social media. We reposted the videos to expose their movements. They were just showing off, but in doing so, they got busted.\" Most important during the assault on Kyiv, says Roman, was the sense of a united Ukraine.

But there were veterans helping civilians. Everyone wanted to defend their city.\"In towns and villages all across the region, hundreds of attacks took place against the convoy, from civilians armed with homemade weapons to mechanised infantry and artillery.Outdated tacticsIn stark contrast to the Ukrainians, the Russian forces repeatedly exposed their inability to make dynamic decisions on the ground. \"The Russians were all carrying large metal boxes marked \\'secret\\',\" says Vladyslav from the 80th Brigade. \"We seized one during an ambush. We found their maps marked with their entire route. After that we knew their whole strategy.\"Their navigation tools were also woefully out of date. In the year since the invasion, the BBC has continued to find maps left behind by Russian troops that date back to the 1960s and 70s. Whole towns exist now that were not on the maps that they were using to navigate. We also found semaphore flags, a vastly outdated way to communicate between units.One successful tactic by the Ukrainian resistance was to blow up bridges and dams ahead of the convoy, thus forcing the Russians to reroute. Reliant on old maps and with limited communications back to their high command, the Russian units frequently became paralysed by indecision.Several satellite images show the Russian vehicles literally driving round and around in circles. Image source, Maxar Technologies 2022OccupationUnder pressure from Ukrainian air strikes and artillery, the Russian convoy was finally brought to a standstill just outside of Kyiv\\'s city boundary. For thousands of civilians living close to the stalled troops, the experience was horrendous. \"They robbed everything from everywhere. They emptied the shops,\" says Vladyslav. \"They also used civilians as human shields.\"What happened in many villages and towns to the north and west of Kyiv is still being investigated by numerous authorities, including the International Criminal Court. After four long weeks the Russians finally started to withdraw.Two of the largest remaining battalions were defeated close to Hostomel airport. Another 370 tented army trucks, seemingly abandoned in Zdvizhivka village, were destroyed by artillery. The Ukrainian military kept on pushing them back until 19 March, after which the Russians began to retreat from Kyiv Oblast.Image source, BBC / Claire Jude PressImage caption, A graveyard of Russian vehicles from the convoy piled high in HostomelRussia is continuing to push into the eastern industrial heartland of Donbas, and strike in the south, in the direction of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.Despite the speculation of a renewed attack on Kyiv, the majority of experts agree it would be unlikely as we have not seen a large-scale deployment of Russian troops to the Belarus border.But still watching via reconnaissance drones close to the border, are the Ukrainian recruits. \"I\\'ll always remember that night in Chernobyl,\" says Vladyslav. \"When I went out to smoke with my friend. But by the time I\\'d finished my cigarette the war had started.\"My friend and I have this dream, that we will go on shift, just like we did that day, and as we smoke another cigarette we will hear that the war has ended. And that we won.\"Special thanks to Slava Shramovych, Marcus Buckley, Michael Whelan, Alastair Thompson, Ben Allen and Tim Coey.

When the Russian army loomed over Ukraine at the end of February 2022, two university students, Maxsym Lutsyk and Dmytro Kisilenko, decided that they could not sit idle when their country was threatened. Maxsym was 19, Dmytro was 18. I met them at a volunteer centre in central Kyiv on the day they signed up to fight. They took their big step into the unknown dressed to go to a festival, not to war. Dmytro had a yoga mat to sleep on. The older volunteers, saying goodbye to wives and children, could barely raise a smile. Young men, not long out of school, not needing to shave much, were laughing and joking, full of bravado. I suspected they didn\\'t feel as brave as they wanted to look. Twelve months later, I caught up with Dmytro and Maxsym in the cold winter sun back at the volunteer centre. \"Well, actually there was a lot of fear,\" Dmytro admitted. \"I\\'m not going to lie because I hadn\\'t experienced anything like that before. There were a lot of pessimistic news and we were preparing for the worst. And it was mostly like a mixture of braveryâ\\x80¦ and in our guts we felt that not everything will be all right.\"Image source, BBC/Jeremy BowenImage caption, Maxsym (left) and Dmytro (right) were students when they volunteered as recruits to fight for their countryMaxsym agreed, and many Ukrainians to whom I\\'ve spoken had the same sort of thoughts. \"A year ago, we had a lot of fear in our hearts and even in our brains. We understood that it will be pretty dangerous to became soldiers, to try to fight with guns. But we also had courage and we had some stupid bravery, and it helped us to overcome our fear. \"We understood that it will be very bad for us to stay in some shelters, not act in the battle. And it will be bad for us if Russians would occupy Kyiv or other territories of Ukraine. They would kill us or put us in prison because of our political views.\"They were not joining a winning army. The Americans and their allies were expecting a rapid Russian victory, followed by an insurgency that they were preparing to support. Their attitudes changed rapidly after Ukraine had shown how well it could fight with old Soviet-era weapons and a sprinkling of modern ones that Nato had supplied. Since then, Nato, led by the United States, has steadily broken its self-imposed limits on what it will supply. Main battle tanks are the latest upgrade. Ukraine wants modern warplanes next. This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 secondsDmytro sat in the cold sun outside the volunteer centre, marvelling at the change. \"The Russians have made their biggest mistakeâ\\x80¦ Everyone knows their enemy now. And not only it\\'s national unity, but it\\'s international unityâ\\x80¦ And it\\'s like someone told me two years ago that the United Kingdom, United States, all the European leaders will help us, and it\\'s the world, Ukraine will be spoken in every television news, I wouldn\\'t have imagined that.\" The conflict forced the North Atlantic alliance to face up to the reality of a sharp and dangerous new division in Europe. The relationship with Moscow that had been under increasing strain for more than a decade snapped when President Putin ordered the invasion last February.With Ukraine, its people and Europe propelled into a new and dangerous era, the continent has come full circle from the hopeful years that followed the end of the Cold War. In 1989, six months before the Berlin Wall was toppled, the first President George Bush laid out the dream of a \"Europe whole and free\". It does not feel like that on the front lines in Donbas. But Kyiv today is a city transformed from the shuttered, apprehensive place it was in the first few weeks after the invasion. Snow swirled around the crowds that packed the platforms at the main railway station. Wind that felt as if it had come off the coldest part of the steppe cut into thousands of women and children, about to become refugees, who were pushing to get onto trains heading west, away from the Russians. Being there felt like watching a re-run of old newsreels from the 20th Century\\'s darkest times. Barriers were blocking roads, welders were making tank traps from steel girders, and thousands of bottles were being filled with petrol to make Molotov cocktails to throw at the Russian tanks everyone expected. At the moment, the capital has a veneer of normality. Shops are open, people with money can go to restaurants, and there is a rush hour. Of course, it is not normal, because the country is at war, and by mid-evening the streets are quiet. Image source, BBC/Jeremy BowenImage caption, Maxsym Lutsyk (left) and Dmytro Kisilenko (right) believe Russia has made its biggest mistakeThe contrast between Kyiv and the battered front line towns in the war zones in the east and south is huge. Dmytro and Maxsym fought in the battle that forced a Russian retreat at the end of March. Since then, the pressure has mostly been off the capital, compared to the nightmarish months since the Russian focus turned to the Donbas and the approaches to the Crimean Peninsula in the south. Maxsym and Dmytro are volunteers, and as students they are allowed to claim an exemption from compulsory military service. Under pressure from his family, Dmytro decided after the Russian withdrawal from Kyiv to go back to university. Now he volunteers to help with supplies for Maxsym and his other former comrades. \"It was a really hard decision. But when all your battle buddies, or when all your comrades are going to the east, they continue, they are like away, and you just left this community, you feel a bit odd.\" His decision does not seem to have affected their friendship. Maxsym stayed with their unit, and in the months since then has been in some of the heaviest fighting of the war, in the battles in Donbas. He looks noticeably older and is more assertive. I saw him in Bakhmut in the summer, as the Russians were starting to attack it. He had driven out of nearby Severodonetsk to get supplies for his unit. He went back that day, and not long before the town fell to the Russians, Maxsym was wounded. Image source, BBC/Jeremy BowenImage caption, In May last year, three months after volunteering, Maxsym met the BBC in BakhmutIt was, he said, his worst moment of the war. His position was hit by a strike from Russian heavy artillery, a 203mm Pion. His commander, who received Ukraine\\'s highest award for valour, was killed. Maxsym was knocked cold and had severe concussion. The Ukrainian forces, outnumbered and outgunned, had to retreat across a river. \"The Russians destroyed all the bridges, doing intelligence to find places where we are crossing the river and they shelled these places. So staying there for longer period of time was possible, but many guys died there. And if we stayed for a longer period, many more guys would have died in a few weeks.\"Maxsym believes that Russian soldiers arrived in Ukraine a year ago swallowing Kremlin propaganda that they would be welcomed as liberators and protectors of Russian speakers. The last year of fighting, he says, on battlegrounds like Severodonetsk and Bakhmut, has wiped out any Russian illusions about what it would take to beat Ukraine. They understand, he said, that they don\\'t have friends waiting for them. \"They know that they will enter Bakhmut city only when they will destroy it, when they will kill every Ukrainian soldier who is defending itâ\\x80¦ They understand that they are fighting for territories and for some political reasons of their government.\"Ukrainian soldiers who have served in the east do not have illusions either about an easy victory. The Russians have taken huge casualties. But they are still fighting, have capable electronic warfare and air defence systems and kill and wound many Ukrainians. The Kremlin\\'s appetite for a war of attrition has not slackened. Image source, EPAImage caption, Russian forces have spent months trying to capture the Ukrainian city of BakhmutDmytro and Maxsym see victory the same way as President Volodymyr Zelensky. Every piece of Ukraine needs to be recaptured. Nato has massively increased its support. But giving Ukraine decisive combat power carries too many risks, in American minds especially. A time may come when Ukraine\\'s allies push for negotiations.Dmytro was firm. \"Every inch of Ukrainian land which were recognized as Ukrainian in 1991 should be Ukrainian.\" President Vladimir Putin believes Ukraine belongs to Russia. Ironically, the war he started is building the Ukrainian nation. \"We have a joke,\" Maxsym said. \"Putin will be made a hero of Ukraine for the job he\\'s done to unite Ukraine, to build our economy, to build our army, and to make the Ukrainian nation great.\"Dmytro laughed. \"But yeah, the war is horrible, but it\\'s like the price for our unity and our country.\"Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warKyivRussiaUkraineMore on this storyStudent-turned-soldier: \\'It was like hell\\'30 May 2022Has Putin\\'s war in Ukraine failed?9 hours agoHow Russia\\'s 35-mile armoured convoy ended in failure2 days agoTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

It is bordered by the Moskva river and the Kremlin on one side, and on the other by imposing Stalinist apartment buildings and 21st Century skyscrapers on the noisy Sadovoye ring road. A maze of narrow streets echo the past, dotted with churches and aristocratic mansions from the 19th Century. Bolshaya Ordinka street takes its name from Tatar-Mongol rule, hundreds of years before, when emissaries would come to collect tributes from Moscow\\'s princely leaders.I was there last February when I was phoned by a friend, born in Ukraine\\'s second-biggest city Kharkiv, who now worked in Moscow.\"Was Putin really going to start a war with Ukraine?\" he asked. Neither of us wanted to believe it.But surrounded by reminders of Russia\\'s often relentlessly violent past I felt war was now inevitable. My daily walks were my way of saying goodbye to a world, and perhaps even a country, that could never be the same again.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Russians have left their country in droves - many when Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation last SeptemberHundreds of thousands of Russians have left Russia, including me and my BBC Russian colleagues. But for the majority who have stayed in Russia, life outwardly is pretty much the same as it always was. Especially in the big cities.In Zamoskvorechiye, most of the shops, cafes, the businesses and the banks are still open. Many of the hipster journalists and IT specialists may have left but others have replaced them.Shoppers complain about rising prices, but local alternatives have replaced some imported goods. Image caption, You can still meet for coffee and the logo looks similar, but the Starbucks chain is long goneBookshops still have a wide variety of titles, although books deemed inappropriate are sold in plastic covers.The popular car-sharing service still works, but the cars are now largely Chinese-made.International sanctions have not brought Russia to the brink of 1990s-style economic collapse. But, as Belfast-based Russian academic Aleksandr Titov has observed, Russia is nonetheless living through a crisis. It is a slow-burning crisis, but look closely and there are signs of it everywhere.In Belgorod, close to the Ukrainian border and just 80km (50 miles) from the now war-torn city of Kharkiv, local people are now used to convoys of military trucks roaring towards the front line. If they are troubled by Russia bombing a city where many have friends and relatives, then they\\'re trying not to show it.Image source, SERGEY BOBOK/AFPImage caption, Most Russians either do not know or do not want to know what their military has done to Ukraine\\'s second biggest city KharkivCheery street festivals organised by the local governor are well attended, a friend tells me.But local doctors are leaving their jobs in droves, unable to cope with the numbers of war-wounded being brought for treatment in local hospitals.The shelled Russian border town backing Putin\\'s warResidents feel abandoned and angry in the little frontier town of Shebekino, where cross-border shelling has become a daily reality. One local family visiting St Petersburg were shocked to find nothing had changed while their own lives had been turned upside down. In Pskov, near the Estonian and Latvian borders, the atmosphere is gloomy and everyone pretends the war has nothing to do with them, I am told.Pskov is home to the 76th Guards Air Assault Division, now notorious for the war crimes its troops are accused of carrying out in Bucha, outside Kyiv.A bus service has started up connecting the city to the local cemetery where growing numbers of soldiers killed in Ukraine are being buried. Under a bridge someone has daubed PEACE in big red letters. Image caption, When the BBC visited this cemetery near Pskov there were dozens of fresh graves for Russian paratroopersOn a train heading for Petrozavodsk, near the Finnish border, a friend meets a group of teenagers playing a \"Name that city\" game. Someone mentions Donetsk: Is it in Russia or Ukraine? None of them are sure. It has been occupied and annexed illegally by their government.How war is seen in rural RussiaHas Putin\\'s war in Ukraine failed?Ukraine war: President Putin speech fact-checkedWhat do they think about the war? It\\'s nothing to do with them. Petrozavodsk appears to have returned to its grim past. Empty shelves, no foreign brands, unaffordably high prices.Do Russians really support the brutality being carried out in Ukraine in their name, or are they pretending it\\'s not happening to survive? From fleeting impressions and conversations it is hard to draw firm conclusions. Sociologists and pollsters have tried to gauge opinion, but there is no freedom of speech or information in Russia so it is impossible to tell if people are being honest.Polls suggest the majority of Russians, if not supporting the war, certainly do not oppose it. This has prompted angry debates among Russians abroad. Many who study and report on Russia, me included, believe a small percentage of people actively support the war, and a small percentage actively oppose it. Most ordinary Russians are in the middle, trying to make sense of a situation they didn\\'t choose, don\\'t understand and feel powerless to change. Could they have stopped it? Probably yes, if more people had stood up for their freedom and challenged state TV propaganda about trumped up threats from the West and Ukraine. Many Russians chose to stay away from politics and let the Kremlin decide for them. But keeping your head down means making very troubling moral compromises.To keep the war from their door, Russians have to pretend this isn\\'t an expansionist invasion, and must close their eyes to the Ukrainians who are killed and wounded in their tens of thousands and driven from their homes in their millions by what the Kremlin calls its \"special military operation\". Image source, MIKHAIL KLIMENTYEV/Sputnik/AFP Image caption, Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church and a Putin ally, has blessed Russia\\'s war effortRussians must accept it\\'s normal for soldiers to go into schools and tell their children war is a good thing.That it\\'s normal for priests to support the war and stop praying for peace.That it doesn\\'t matter they can no longer travel or be part of a broader world.That the Kremlin was right to block the majority of independent media sites they used to read.That a sledgehammer is now a positive symbol of Russian power in executions captured on camera and posted by MPs on Twitter.And that it\\'s normal to go to jail for years for saying what you think about the war, whether you\\'re a councillor or a journalist.Why Russians do not protest is perhaps better explained by Russian history and not opinion polls. Ever since he came to power, President Vladimir Putin has made it no secret that he wants to rebuild Russia and restore its position for the world to respect and reckon with.In speeches and essays he has made clear his belief that Russia occupies a unique place in the world as part of both the East and West. Russia has its own traditions, religion, and its own ways of doing things. Russians need order and control, and demand respect.Image source, YURI KADOBNOV/AFPImage caption, Vladimir Putin always blames the West for the war and state TV repeats his world viewThis message has echoed down the centuries and brooks no dissent or prospect for change. It\\'s a chokehold - to use a judo term from his favourite sport.This Putin vision comes with a price: Russians have paid with their freedom Ukrainians are paying with their lives.Russia has opened up at times after moments of calamity and catastrophe. After defeat in Afghanistan in 1989 came the Gorbachev era. Defeat against Japan in 1905 was followed by constitutional reform, and after defeat in the Crimean war in 1856 came emancipation of the serfs.One pattern identified by pollsters is that most Russians say they would support peace talks to end the fighting. But what kind of guarantees they would give independent Ukraine is not yet clear. Sooner or later, that will need to be answered and Russians will have to confront what their country has done.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warRussiaMoscowVladimir PutinMore on this storyHas Putin\\'s war in Ukraine failed?9 hours agoTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

Speaking at a news conference marking his first 100 days in office on Wednesday, the South Korean president reiterated that he was willing to provide phased economic aid to the North if it stopped developing nuclear weapons and took steps towards denuclearisation.Ms Kim\\'s remarks on Friday were the first time a senior official from the North directly commented on Mr Yoon\\'s plan.Kim Yo-jong: North Korea\\'s heir apparent?North Korea crisis in 300 wordsNorth Korea\\'s missile and nuclear programmeShe said she did not know what else Mr Yoon would come up with if the plan did not work, but made clear that Pyongyang would \"never deal with it\".The Korean peninsula has been divided between the north and the south since the end of World War II in 1945. The two sides remain technically at war after a conflict ended with an armistice in 1953.While democratic South Korea\\'s economy has flourished over the past few decades, the communist-ruled North has always struggled with food shortages. It has also consistently faced international sanctions over its nuclear programme. Last year, the UN\\'s special rapporteur on human rights in the country, Tomas Ojea Quintana, said North Koreans were struggling to \"live a life of dignity\", with the sanctions and a Covid -induced imports worsening food shortages.Although Mr Kim has admitted the country was dealing with shortages, he has refused to back down on nuclear weapons development. Pyongyang has conducted regular missile tests over the years. Last month, Mr Kim said the country was ready for military confrontation with the US, and prepared to mobilise its nuclear forces.Ms Kim, born in 1987, is Mr Kim\\'s youngest sister and closest ally among his siblings. She has been touted among the top ranks of his potential successors.Since 2014, her main role has been to protect her brother\\'s image as a key official in the propaganda department. In this capacity, she has often delivered strongly-worded statements against the South and its allies, for example telling the US last year not to \"cause a stink\" by conducting joint military exercises with Seoul.

We will publish their stories on this page throughout the day.BBCCopyright: BBCYevhen and AndriyImage caption: Yevhen and Andriy33 year-old Yevhen Olefirenko was a history graduate who worked in the hotel business. He volunteered for Kyiv’s territorial defence force on the first day of the war. “History was his passion and I guess he realised there are times to study history and there are times when you are part of history,” his brother Andriy says. Yevhen had done some military training and he became a platoon commander for an international brigade on the eastern front. His military call sign -“Elvis” - said more about his hairstyle than his singing style. Yevhen’s heavy metal band -“Black Forces” - played music that was “terrible enough to use as a psychological weapon against the Russians”, his brother jokes. During a Russian tank assault near Bakhmut last July a piece of shrapnel struck Yevhen just above his flak jacket and killed him. He left behind a widow and an eight year-old daughter.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.AnalysisPosted at 14:5814:58Putin seems determined to push on after one year of warSteve RosenbergBBC Russia editorVladimir Putin had expected a swift victory, that would force Ukraine back into Moscow’s orbit. But his so-called ‘special military operation’ did not go according to plan. Over the last twelve months the Russian military has suffered heavy casualties – the Kremlin had to declare mobilisation to boost troop numbers, drafting hundreds of thousands of Russians into the army. As this war enters its second year, President Putin appears determined to push on – confident that Russia has the resources to secure eventually a military victory over Ukraine and over the West. International sanctions have hurt the Russian economy, but what they haven’t done is trigger economic collapse or a Kremlin U-turn on Ukraine. For now, there is little public pressure here on Putin to end the fighting. Many Russians believe what the state media is telling them – that Russia’s not the aggressor, and that it’s fighting for peace.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 14:4914:49Vuhledar, the mining town Russia wants to takeOrla GuerinReporting from Vuhledar, eastern UkraineGoktay Koraltan/BBCCopyright: Goktay Koraltan/BBCUkraine has managed to hold Vuhledar in eastern Ukraine despite fierce Russian attempts to seize itImage caption: Ukraine has managed to hold Vuhledar in eastern Ukraine despite fierce Russian attempts to seize itThe commander, codenamed Beast, looked exhausted.Beneath his green helmet, dark shadows ringed his eyes.

A church has been reduced to a shell - its roof peeled off and windows shattered. A cross still stands at the front, punctured by shrapnel. In the playground, there are bullet holes in the slide.

Among them is Alexander - a 30-year-old man who fled the country days after Putin announced the start of mobilisation. \"I didn\\'t want to have to kill anybody,\" he tells me. He is currently in Armenia and like many others, he left Russia with no idea of when, or if, he will ever go back. \"People have been very welcoming and warm to us both in Turkey and Armenia. It doesn’t cease to amaze me. It feels like we are more welcome and appreciated here than in our own country - and I don’t just mean wartime.”\"I’ll do anything within my powers not to go back to Russia unless there are some dramatic changes for the better and I’m sure it’s safe there,\" he says.

So far, it has achieved little more than exposing the brutality and inadequacy of the Russian military.Here are some of the key setbacks: The retreat of about 30,000 Russian troops across the Dnipro river from Kherson in November was a strategic failure A 56km(35mile) armoured convoy that ground to a halt near Kyiv at the start of the war was a logistical failure The deaths of a large number of recently mobilised troops in a Ukrainian new-year missile attack on Makiivka were an intelligence failure The sinking of the flagship Black Sea battle cruiser the Moskva was a defensive failure, as was the spectacular attack in October 2022 that shut the Kerch Strait bridge for weeks Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 14:0814:08What tanks is Ukraine set to receive from allies?.Copyright: .With the news Poland has already delivered four German-manufactured Leopard 2 tanks - widely considered to be one of the most effective main battle tanks available - now might to be a good time to recap what similar hardware Ukraine is set to receive.On the main battle tank front: the US is sending 31 of its M1 Abrams tanks, the UK is providing 14 Challenger 2 tanks and Germany, 14 Leopard 2 tanks.Spain says it\\'s sending six of its Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, while Poland is set to deliver 10 more on top of the four announced today. The Leopard 2 is used by a number of European countries, and is considered to be easier to maintain and more fuel-efficient than most other Western tanks..Copyright: .In the months which followed the Russian invasion, Nato preferred member countries to supply tanks which had been in use by former Soviet states, as Ukraine\\'s armed forces know how to operate them, how to maintain them, and had a lot spare parts.Ukraine used T-72 tanks prior to the invasion, and since February 2022 has received more than 200 of these Soviet-designed machines from Poland, the Czech Republic and a small number of other countries.If you\\'d like to read more about the M1 Abrams, Challenger 2 and other key pieces of military hardware supplied to Ukraine over the last year, click here.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 13:5813:58No 10: Sunak wants allies to send Ukraine long-range weaponsHelen CattPolitical correspondentEPACopyright: EPASunak and his wife, Akshata Murthy, earlier led a national minute\\'s silence outside Downing StreetImage caption: Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murthy, earlier led a national minute\\'s silence outside Downing StreetUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wants to see allies join the UK in supplying Ukraine with \"weapons that are able to degrade Russian forces beyond the frontline\", his deputy official spokesman says.

He\\'ll tell world leaders that \"sophisticated capability will help protect critical civilian infrastructure and will preserve frontline defences\".He\\'s also expected to reiterate an offer of UK support to countries able to provide fast jets.

Instead, she has stayed and led the BBC’s coverage of the biggest story of the past year.I’ve been sitting down for a chat with Kate at a hotel in Kyiv that now provides a base for BBC staff here.In the days immediately after Russia’s invasion, Kate had to build a new team, including local producers and drivers.“It was an enormous challenge. I’ve been doing this for a long time and have covered some big stories, but really this was quite extraordinary. A war in Europe. Right on our doorstep,” she tells me.Kate says she was sitting in the same room that we are now in together when the first sirens sounded in Kyiv a year ago today.“I don’t think any of us will ever forget that. Everybody froze,” she recalls.BBCCopyright: BBCSome of her biggest memories from the past year include correspondents Clive Myrie and Lyse Doucet presenting the news from a shelter erected in the carpark of the building - and at one point having to try to slow down a child who had run over Clive’s feet.“Who would have predicted that we would be presenting the main BBC One bulletins from an underground car park in a hotel in Kyiv? And yet, it worked,” she says.Kate says she didn’t need long to think about whether to stay in Ukraine to cover the story, even though it means that she has not been able to return to her Moscow home since.“I had to be here. I couldn’t be anywhere else. We needed to report what was going on,” she says.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 13:4213:42UK falls silent to mark one-year anniversary of Russian invasion of UkraineA minute\\'s silence was observed this morning across the UK to mark the first anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Part of the profits are used to support the local Ukrainian community and fund aid for the war-torn country.Image caption, Lena Sutherland said she had \"cried\" over the destruction of her homeland\"I spoke to girls who came this year from the eastern part of Ukraine,\" she said.\"Their life is shattered, they don\\'t have a life or happiness. They can\\'t see their family, it\\'s difficult for them\"I cried together with them, because I have my home here in England and are quite happy but I can\\'t be happy when I know my country is destroyed.\"Local supporters also attended to mark the anniversary.Louis Ramsden from lifeboat charity Humber Rescue helped gather up and ship over aid, with five lorry loads leaving Hull for Kyiv.He said people in Hull were still making donations.\"We still have great support, people are still willing to give what they have,\" he said.\"Of course we have a cost-of-living crisis here, but I think people do appreciate there are bigger things going off in the world that are slightly more significant than higher energy bills.\"People are losing their homes, people have really been subjected to barbaric conditions and everyone wants to support them and ease their suffering and pain somewhat.\"Image caption, Students Bazhena Kukhot (L) and Anastasiia Didyk said exiles were grateful for the support of people in HullUkrainian student Anastasiia Didyk described the invasion as a \" significant date in our history\".\"This day changed everyone and everyone remembers this day as fear and pride,\" she said.\"Proud for themselves, for their country, for their army, for their contribution. From the 24 February 2022 we have a different life and a different people.\" \"This war changed us. Honouring this day can be equated with the birth of a new nation.\"Fellow student Bazhena Kukhot said the Ukrainian refugees were very grateful for the support local people had offered.\"It was really difficult to leave our cities, our country and our families,\" she said.\"We came alone here and it was a rough time, but people here are really supportive.\"We are really thankful to them because they gave us everything we needed, like clothes, toiletries and everything.\"They just saved our lives.\"Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

What types of fruit and veg are running low? The UK\\'s largest supermarket, Tesco, and discounter Aldi have said they are putting limits of three per customer on sales of tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers.Asda has capped sales of lettuces, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflowers and raspberry punnets to three per customer, along with tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers.And Morrisons has set limits of two on cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuces and peppers.Tomatoes and peppers seem to be the worst affected but it\\'s unclear whether this is simply because they are popular. Other major supermarkets have also been hit by the shortages but have not yet introduced limits for customers. Former Sainsbury\\'s chief executive Justin King told the BBC that limits were being put in place to prevent other retailers buying stock.\"Even High Street greengrocers, when they can\\'t get their stock from wholesalers, will start buying off the [supermarket] shelves.\"Why is there a shortage? In the winter months the UK imports around 95% of its tomatoes and 90% of its lettuces, most of them from Spain and north Africa, according to trade group the British Retail Consortium (BRC).But southern Spain has been suffering unusually cold weather and in Morocco crop yields have been affected by floods, while storms have caused ferries to be delayed or cancelled.It led to Morocco barring exports of tomatoes, onions and potatoes to West African countries earlier this month as it tried to protect exports to Europe. The UK also gets some produce at this time of year from domestic growers and the Netherlands. But farmers in both countries have cut back on their use of greenhouses to grow winter crops due to higher electricity prices.The National Farmers\\' Union has called for more support for UK growers, noting the horticulture sector was not included in the government\\'s support scheme for energy-intensive industries.How long will it last? The shortages are only expected to last \"a few weeks\" until the UK growing season begins and supermarkets find alternative sources of supply, according to the BRC.It added that supermarkets were \"adept\" at managing supply chain issues and were working with farmers to ensure there was enough fresh produce for customers. On Thursday, Environment Secretary Therese Coffey said the situation would \"last about another two to four weeks\".However, one UK producers\\' group has said shortages of some fruit and vegetables could last until May.The Lea Valley Growers Association - which produces around three-quarters of the UK\\'s cucumber and pepper crops - says some producers have delayed planting crops due to high energy costs over the winter.Image source, Getty ImagesHas Brexit had an impact?Anecdotal evidence suggests the UK has been bearing the brunt of the shortages, but problems have also been reported in Ireland, which is part of the EU. Other European countries appear less affected with shelves across continental Europe, from Spain to Poland, heaving with fresh produce.Wholesalers, importers and retailers the BBC has spoken to suggested the UK may be suffering because of lower domestic production and more complex supply chains, as well as a price-sensitive market. But they said Brexit was unlikely to be a factor.However, Ksenija Simovic, a senior policy adviser at Copa-Cogeca, a group which represents farmers and farming co-operatives in the EU, said Brexit wasn\\'t the primary reason but it hadn\\'t helped.In her view, businesses within Europe benefit both from being closer to where products are grown, and from simpler, better-coordinated supply chains.Ultimately, she thinks, if there is a shortage of supply then the produce that is available is simply more likely to remain within the Single Market.\"It doesn\\'t help that the UK is out of the EU and single market, but I don\\'t think this is the primary reason the UK is having shortages,\" Ms Simovic added.The full impact of the Brexit changes have also yet to be felt when it comes to fresh produce entering the country from the EU. Customs declarations are required, but border controls are not due to be implemented until 1 January 2024 - while imports from Morocco, which is outside the EU, are already subject to border checks.Are you seeing food shortages?

He told Rishi Sunak: “His predecessor told businesses that there would be no forms, no checks, no barriers of any kind - that was absolute nonsense.”Back in 2019 - before agreeing to the protocol - Mr Johnson told Sky News: “There will be no checks on goods going from GB to NI, or NI to GB.”This ran counter to an internal government assessment of the impact of the deal at the time. Since the protocol came into force, more than a quarter of a million products of animal origin have been inspected at Northern Ireland\\'s ports, according to official figures.You can read more in this piece.

When it was part of the former Soviet Union, nuclear weapons were based in Ukraine. But these were given up when Ukraine joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1994. In 2021, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany suggested that if Ukraine couldn\\'t join Nato, it might have to reconsider its nuclear-free status.However, the government in Kyiv has not expressed an intention to acquire nuclear weapons, and a military strategy document published in 2021 did not refer to them.And the UN\\'s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says it has seen no signs in Ukraine \"of the diversion of nuclear material, intended for peaceful activities, for other purposes\".Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 10:37 21 Feb10:37 21 FebYes, Russia\\'s economy has performed better than expectedReality CheckEarlier in the speech President Putin said that the Russian economy had only shrunk by 2.2% in 2022 , adding: \"I’ll remind you that in February or March they predicted a collapse of the Russian economy.”That estimate of a 2.2% contraction in the economy measured by GDP in 2022 can be found in the latest report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The 2.2% contraction still makes it the worst-performing country on the IMF’s list, but the organisation confirms that it has contracted by less than expected.Why? The IMF said that Russian trade was being redirected to countries not applying sanctions against it. India and China have become the largest buyers of Russian oil, for example, as Western nations restrict purchases and impose sanctions.In July 2022, the IMF was predicting a 6% contraction in Russian GDP for the year.You can read more about the Russian economy\\'s performance here.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 17:17 20 Feb17:17 20 FebWhat support is China giving Russia?By Reality CheckBBC NewsChina could be providing military intelligence to Russia as well as economic support.Read morenextArticle share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 17:14 20 Feb17:14 20 FebWhat did Boris Johnson say about Northern Ireland deal?By Reality Check teamBBC NewsBoris Johnson says the Northern Ireland Brexit deal he negotiated is \"turning into a political problem\".Read morenextArticle share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 0:21 20 Feb0:21 20 FebPoverty, jobs, security: Nigeria poll claims checkedBy Reality CheckBBC NewsClaims about poverty, unemployment and insecurity feature prominently in this election campaign.Read morenextArticle share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 15:03 15 Feb15:03 15 FebWhat has happened to the attainment gap in Scotland?Reality CheckNicola Sturgeon was asked repeatedly by journalists at her press conference about the attainment gap between rich and poor pupils, which the SNP pledged to \"substantially eliminate\" within a decade, in their 2016 programme for government.Journalists told the first minister the gap “remains pretty wide”.She did not directly answer the question.The latest figures from the Scottish government compare the gap in attainment by the most and least deprived pupils between 2016-17 and 2021-22, and suggest that it has not narrowed very much, although Covid may have affected the figures.The report compared the proportion of pupils achieving the expected levels based on the judgment of their teachers from the most deprived 20% and the least deprived 20% of the population.On literacy, the gap was 22.1 percentage points in 2016-17 and 21.3 percentage points in 2021-22.On numeracy, the gap was 17.6 percentage points in 2016-17 and 17.8 percentage points in 2021-22.You can see these figures in charts 1 and 2 in this report.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 14:35 15 Feb14:35 15 FebWhat is levelling up and who is it helping?By Reality Check teamBBC NewsThe government has awarded funding to projects all over the country as part of its \"levelling up\" plan.Read morenextArticle share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 19:08 9 Feb19:08 9 FebThe collapsed buildings that were meant to withstand earthquakesBy Jake Horton & William ArmstrongBBC Reality Check & BBC MonitoringRecently built properties advertised as earthquake-proof were among collapsed buildings in Turkey.Read morenextArticle share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 13:55 9 Feb13:55 9 FebTreasury imposes spending curb on Gove departmentBy Chas GeigerBBC NewsNew funding for major building projects will need permission, a minister has confirmed.Read morenextArticle share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 14:07 8 Feb14:07 8 FebInvestigating the false images of Turkey destructionReality CheckPictures and video from previous disasters in other countries have been shared by people on social media with claims that they show the current destruction caused by the earthquake in Turkey and Syria.One tweet - from a verified Twitter user - claimed to show a nuclear plant exploding in Turkey.

In a split decision the majority of judges ruled that Kenya\\'s NGO board should have allowed the registration of an LGBTQ group - called National Gays and Lesbians Human Rights Commission - which it had blocked in 2013.The judges said the constitution guaranteed the right to association and that the NGO board should not deny the registration of an association purely based on the sexual orientation of the applicants, or because it has the word \"gay\" or \"lesbian\" in it.In its ruling, however, the Supreme Court stressed that gay sex remained illegal in Kenya.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 11:3111:31Ghana\\'s Christian Atsu was \\'one in a million\\'By Oluwashina Okeleji and Ian WilliamsBBC Sport AfricaHow the former Newcastle midfielder, who lost his life in the Turkey-Syria earthquakes, grew from humble beginnings into a star who supported orphans and rehabilitated criminals.Read morenextArticle share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 11:3011:30Nigerian secessionist leader arrested in FinlandBy Chiagozie NwonwuBBC News, LagosSimon Ekpa has called for a boycott of Nigeria\\'s election, and allegedly incited violence on social media.Read morenextArticle share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 11:2211:22Cyclone Freddy makes landfall in MozambiqueSarah Keith-LucasBBC Weather presenterTropical Cyclone Freddy has made landfall in Mozambique.It has been restrengthening in the Mozambique Channel with winds up to 128km/h (80mph).

He died shortly after that,” he said.Mr Guyo told the BBC that his family had lost all their cattle.Another resident said he had lost all but four of his 150 cattle.More than 800,000 people require emergency food assistance because of the drought, according to the disaster prevention and food security office in Borena zone.“The number of people seeking aid is increasing” the head of the office told the BBC. Food aid is being provided by the government and non-governmental organisations but the needs are far higher than what’s been delivered, he added.A branch of the office in the area however said it had no information about the people dying from food scarcity.The Horn of Africa region is suffering from what the UN has called “the most severe drought in two generations” after five consecutive failed rainy seasons.The UN’s migration agency IOM had previously said that more than 4.5 million cattle had died since 2021 because of the drought in Ethiopia.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 10:3110:31Street food inspires new hip-hop opera mash-upVideo contentVideo caption: Hip-hop opera: Genres meet in jollof inspired productionHip-hop opera: Genres meet in jollof inspired productionA hip-hop artist has written an opera about his experience making Nigerian food during the pandemic.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 10:0710:07Port closed as Cyclone Freddy nears MozambiqueJose TembeBBC News, MaputoAFPCopyright: AFPMozambique\\'s Beira port has been closed as as tropical cyclone Freddy approaches the nation\\'s southern region.Beira is the second-largest city by size in Mozambique by population and its port sits on the mouth of the Pungwe river, that runs to Zimbabwe.In a statement, the port\\'s operator said all indications point to the probability of the cyclone affecting the city.Operations will resume once the weather conditions improve, Cornelder de Moçambique said in a statement.“We appeal to our customers who may have trucks that are on route to the port of Beira to stay in safer places until the weather conditions improve,” it added.Schools have been closed in the areas thought to be in high risk, mainly in the coastal provinces of Inhambane and Sofala.

Both regions have recently been affected first by warm weather - which affected crop yields - then by a cold snap which has meant longer growth times.Cancelled ferries from Morocco due to bad weather have also affected supplies.Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC, said supermarkets were \"adept at managing supply chain issues and are working with farmers to ensure that customers are able to access a wide range of fresh produce\".However, other businesses have also been affected.The Heritage Fine Food Company in Wiltshire, a wholesaler which supplies restaurants, cafes and schools in the south west of England, warned on its website that sourcing tomatoes was \"incredibly challenging\". Cucumbers, it said, were \"incredibly limited in supply\", while peppers were failing to ripen.A portion of the fruit and vegetables the UK imports during the winter comes from the Netherlands, where they are grown in large greenhouses. While it is clear that the businesses producing them have been badly affected by high energy prices, it is not clear whether that has had an impact on supplies in the UK.

In an interview last week, the Bajan singer was asked if there would be any surprises during her performance at Arizona\\'s State Farm Stadium.\"I\\'m thinking about bringing someone,\" she replied. \"I\\'m not sure, we\\'ll see.\" Naturally, fans assumed she was talking about one of the many artists she\\'s collaborated with during her illustrious career. A guest spot from Jay-Z, Drake or Eminem seemed both likely and in keeping with the half-time show tradition of surprise duets.But Rihanna wasn\\'t referring to any of them. Although nobody twigged at the time, she was in fact hinting that she was pregnant with her second child. The singer may have failed to debut any new music during her performance at Sunday\\'s Super Bowl, but the baby bump she debuted instead almost broke the internet.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Rihanna appeared on a floating platform above a swarm of energetic dancers, all dressed in whiteImage source, ReutersImage caption, Rihanna\\'s representatives confirmed she was pregnant shortly after her performanceWearing an all-red custom jumpsuit by Loewe, Rihanna appeared on one of several floating platforms which soared high above the crowd, as a swarm of energetic dancers, all dressed in white, gathered below.The audience went wild as the singer launched straight into Better Have My Money - a somewhat ironic choice of opener considering she is not being paid for her Super Bowl performance.As the 34-year-old dazzled the crowd from on high, her dancers performed beneath her at breakneck speed, in a display of razor-sharp choreography which they would maintain throughout the whole performance. The singer rattled through several recognisable hits, front-loading her set with some of her most danceable and up-tempo numbers including Only Girl (In The World) and the excellent Where Have You Been.It was a half-time show not short on spectacle, even once she had been lowered to the ground. Fireworks were let off above the stadium as she launched into the euphoric We Found Love.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Rihanna\\'s dancers performed razor-sharp routines at breakneck speedWhile rumours that the star might take the opportunity to perform new music failed to materialise, the decision to rely on her extensive back catalogue, one of the strongest in pop, was a sensible one.The singer packed a huge number of hits into a tight 14-minute set, only performing the first verse or chorus of certain songs. But monster hits such as Rude Boy were balanced with the somewhat harder-edged and lesser-known Pour It Up.Somewhat disappointingly, the set list took advantage of some of her best-known collaborations - without any of her collaborators actually joining her on stage.As she performed Run This Town, All of the Lights and Wild Thoughts, there were no appearances from Jay-Z, Ye (formerly Kanye West) or DJ Khaled, who normally feature on those tracks.But their absence didn\\'t matter. By this point, everyone\\'s attention was firmly on an entirely different, and very visible, special guest.Which songs did Rihanna perform?Image source, ReutersImage caption, The Super Bowl marked Rihanna\\'s first televised live performance since the 2018 Grammys1. Better Have My Money2. Where Have You Been3. Only Girl (In The World)4. We Found Love5. Rude Boy6. Work7. Wild Thoughts8. Birthday Cake (instrumental) / Pour It Up9. All of the Lights10. Run This Town11. Umbrella12. DiamondsConfusion initially permeated social media as fans rushed to share their theories about Rihanna\\'s apparent baby bump. Many pointed out the singer is known for her body positivity and could well have just been showing off her curvier figure following her previous pregnancy.Although the star\\'s bump was on display throughout, Rihanna did not draw attention to it quite as explicitly as BeyoncÃ© did at the MTV VMAs in 2011, where she memorably dropped her microphone, unbuttoned her jacket and rubbed her belly.But as Rihanna\\'s set progressed on Sunday, viewers became increasingly confident she was pregnant again, nine months after she and her partner A$AP Rocky welcomed their son.Within an hour of Rihanna\\'s performance drawing to a close, as her fans debated exactly which trimester she might be in, her representatives officially confirmed the singer\\'s good news.While some fans admitted to a tinge of disappointment that this will likely mean yet another delay to Rihanna\\'s much-anticipated ninth studio album, the reaction on social media was overwhelmingly joyful. Image source, ReutersImage caption, Rihanna chose not to perform her most recent song, Lift Me Up from Black Panther: Wakanda ForeverElsewhere, there were no costume changes during Rihanna\\'s set - quite understandably - and her band looked positively tiny compared with the number of dancers. Unlike last year\\'s half-time show, which saw Eminem take the knee on stage, Rihanna\\'s set was distinctly light on political statements - something which may surprise those who remember why she previously turned down the Super Bowl.The singer confirmed to Vogue in 2019 she had declined the invitation in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who controversially knelt during the national anthem in protest against racism and police brutality. \"I just couldn\\'t be a sellout. I couldn\\'t be an enabler,\" she said at the time.Four years later, \"taking the knee\" is much more commonplace, particularly in light of the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, and Rihanna\\'s headlining of the Super Bowl is perhaps a sign of her approval of the NFL\\'s progress in recent years.Fans broadly agreed her performance was worth the wait, featuring a set list which she had joked earlier in the week had been through 39 drafts before it was finalised.Rihanna even found time to subtly plug her cosmetics brand, by fixing her make-up mid-performance - something which quickly became another of the night\\'s viral moments.Meanwhile, the annual jokes about the culture clash between pop music fans and sports fans were in full swing on social media, with Rihanna even embracing them herself.Ahead of the show, her clothing label manufactured T-shirts with the slogan: \"Rihanna concert interrupted by a football game. Weird but whatever.\" Model Cara Delevingne was among the attendees sporting one on Sunday.Skip instagram post by caradelevingneAllow Instagram content?This article contains content provided by Instagram.

It\\'s more distinctive than it is powerful, the kind of voice you would recognise instantly as hers on the radio, even if it was an unfamiliar song.Ahead of her Super Bowl debut, Stereogum\\'s Tom Breihan noted: \"Rihanna never needed to over-sing anything she always sounded too cool to emote.\"But what has set Rihanna apart from some of her peers is the sheer number of hits she has to her name. In the late noughties and early 2010s, she churned out chart-toppers faster than the industry\\'s top songwriters could compose them. She released seven albums in as many years, scoring a new worldwide hit every few weeks. As a result, perhaps one inevitable disappointment with her Super Bowl set was the number of songs she simply couldn\\'t squeeze in. Some of her earlier smashes, such as Pon de Replay and SOS, would have gone down a treat, as would the pounding Don\\'t Stop The Music and the catchy What\\'s My Name (although we did get a tiny snippet of the latter right at the beginning, before she appeared on stage).Image source, ReutersImage caption, Rihanna hinted she was pregnant during an interview last weekOther fan favourites, such as the rather graphic S&M, were probably wise to avoid, given the Super Bowl\\'s history with pop stars offending family audiences during the half-time show. However, the song wasn\\'t missing entirely - its vocal hook was layered on top of We Found Love, while a few seconds of another risquÃ© but popular track, Birthday Cake, were teased just before Pour It Up.And surely everybody can be grateful that her set wasn\\'t dragged down by her most recent release - Lift Me Up, from the soundtrack to Marvel\\'s Wakanda Forever. A perfectly nice song which deserves its Oscar nomination, but one which would not have worked at the Super Bowl.Instead, Rihanna deployed some of her biggest hits as she hurtled towards the end of her set, climaxing with her ode to British weather, Umbrella, and the rousing, anthemic Diamonds. It may not have grabbed the headlines for the reasons fans were expecting, but Rihanna delivered a half-time show they will never forget.Related TopicsSuper BowlMore on this storyChiefs fight back to beat Eagles in Super Bowl classic13 FebruaryEminem takes the knee at Super Bowl half-time show14 February 2022Rihanna gears up for Super Bowl half-time show9 FebruaryTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

In a statement, Thomas H Lee\\'s family said they were \"extremely saddened\" by the 78-year-old\\'s death. The New York Post reports that he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his Manhattan office.The NYPD told the BBC an unnamed 78-year-old man had been found dead on Thursday morning at 767 Fifth Avenue.The address is where the offices of Thomas H Lee Capital LLC are listed. According to Forbes, Mr Lee was worth $2bn (Â£1.6bn) at his time of death. The police spokesman did not confirm the man had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, noting the cause of death would be for a medical examiner to determine.In a statement to BBC News, police said they had responded to a 911 call shortly after 11:00 (16:00 GMT) on Thursday morning from an office on Fifth Avenue.\"Upon arrival EMS [Emergency Medical Services] responded and pronounced the male deceased at the scene,\" they said.A statement by family friend and spokesman Michael Sitrick said: \"While the world knew him as one of the pioneers in the private equity business and a successful businessman, we knew him as a devoted husband, father, grandfather, sibling, friend and philanthropist who always put others\\' needs before his own.\"Alongside his pioneering of the leveraged buyout, Mr Lee was also known for acquiring beverage company Snapple in 1992 and selling it two years later to Quaker Oats for $1.7bn - 32 times what he bought it for.Mr Lee was also celebrated for his philanthropy, and had served as a trustee for prominent New York City art organisations like the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the Museum of Modern Art. In 1996, he donated $22m to his alma mater Harvard University, part of which has been used to provide financial aid for students. \"I\\'ve been lucky to make some money. I\\'m more than happy to give some of it back,\" he said at the time.He is survived by his wife, Ann Tenenbaum, and his five children.

Addressing a meeting of senior leaders, Mr Kim said: \"The people\\'s food situation is now getting tense\". He said the agricultural sector had failed to meet its grain targets due to typhoons last year, which caused flooding.There are reports that food prices have spiked, with NK News reporting that a kilogram of bananas costs $45 (Â£32).North Korea has closed its borders to contain the spread of Covid-19. Trade with China has plummeted as a result. North Korea relies on China for food, fertiliser and fuel. Kim Jong-un wages war on slang, jeans and films N Korea\\'s Kim warns of crisis amid famine threatN Korea to skip Tokyo Olympics over Covid fearsNorth Korea is also struggling under international sanctions, imposed because of its nuclear programmes. The authoritarian leader of the single-party state talked about the food situation at the ruling Workers\\' Party central committee which started this week in the capital Pyongyang.During the meeting, Mr Kim said that national industrial output had grown by a quarter compared to the same period last year.Officials were expected to discuss relations with the US and South Korea during the event but no details have been released yet.In April, Mr Kim made a a rare admission of looming hardship, calling on officials to \"wage another, more difficult \\'Arduous March\\' in order to relieve our people of the difficulty, even a little\".The Arduous March is a term used by North Korea officials to refer to the country\\'s struggle during the 1990s famine, when the fall of the Soviet Union left North Korea without crucial aid. The total number of North Koreans who starved to death at the time is not known, but estimates range up to three million.It is highly unusual for Kim Jong-un to publicly acknowledge a food shortage. But this is a North Korean leader who has already admitted that his economic plan has failed. The problem for Mr Kim is that when he took over from his father, he promised his people a more prosperous future. He said they would have meat on their tables and access to electricity. This has not happened. Now he\\'s having to prime the population for more hard work. He is trying to tie this into the global pandemic, and state media reported that he pointed out to party officials that the situation across the world is getting \"worse and worse\". With so little access to outside information, he can paint a picture of things being bad everywhere - not just in sealed off North Korea. He also described efforts to beat Covid-19 as a \"protracted war\". That signals that border closures are not easing any time soon. That is the concern of many aid organisations. The sealed border has prevented some food and medicine getting through. Most NGOs have had to leave the country, unable to get staff and supplies in or out.Pyongyang has always called for \"self-reliance\". It has closed itself off, just as it may need assistance and it is unlikely to ask for help. If it continues to push away all offers of international assistance, as ever, it may be the people who pay the price.

Mirza and her partner Madison Keys lost the first round match in straight sets, drawing the curtains on her 20-year professional tennis career.Life update :) pic.twitter.com/bZhM89GXga— Sania Mirza (@MirzaSania) January 13, 2023 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterWith six Grand Slam doubles titles under her belt, Mirza is easily India\\'s most successful tennis star.Over the decades, she\\'s won 43 major career titles, becoming the first ever Indian to make number one in the WTA doubles rankings, a feat achieved in 2015. The devotion of Mirza\\'s fans has remained unrivalled, surviving triumphs by her opponents and injuries that dogged her over the years. Her best run came in 2015 when she and Martina Hingis won 16 titles, including three grand slams, ranking them the greatest women\\'s doubles pair of all time. But Mirza\\'s story is special because she made it as a professional sportswoman, despite the odds being stacked against her. Born in 1986, she grew up in the southern city of Hyderabad at a time when tennis as a profession was only for the wealthy. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mirza was famously asked about choosing between motherhood and her career in an interview by a senior journalistShe began playing aged six on pot-holed courts made of cow dung - a frugal trade-off between between clay and hard courts.Mirza turned out to be a natural and found success as a junior tennis player, winning the 2003 Wimbledon Championships girls\\' doubles title when she was 15.But she burst into the spotlight in 2005 when she made it to the third round of the Australian Open - the first Indian woman to reach this stage of a major in singles - to face superstar Serena Williams.It was an extraordinary feat - cricket-obsessed Indians tuned in to watch the teenager go up against a player already cementing her place as the greatest of all time. Mirza lost the match but her career embodying not just tennis but women\\'s sport in India had taken off.In a pre-internet era, her matches brought people together as they watched her play, glued to their TV screens. She was a regular feature in Indian sports pages. Many Indians have early memories of a player who, for once, looked and spoke like them, and was doing great things.But while many celebrated Mirza\\'s rise, a group of Muslim clerics issued a fatwa, denouncing her tennis clothes as \"indecent\", \"un-Islamic\" and \"corrupting\".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sania Mirza\\'s immense popularity often made her the subject of intense scrutiny and vitriol in her own countryIt marked the start of waves of backlash the star, then just 18, would receive for the choices she made on and off court.Mirza, proudly Muslim, practised her religion on her own terms without it really impeding her goals and aspirations and it was liberating to watch this unfold in public.Her responses to comments on her clothes, like her tennis moves, were measured yet incisive, sometimes even dramatic. The player would wear T-shirts and caps with searing one-liners - \\'You can\\'t handle the truth\\' or \\'You can either agree with me or be wrong\\' - to tournaments and events.Her immense popularity would often make her the subject of intense scrutiny and vitriol in her own country. But Mirza appeared to have an ironclad sense of self and was never seen cowed by it.In 2008, she announced she had no desire to play in India as she chose to boycott its most prestigious tennis tournament, the Bangalore Open.\"Every time I play in India, there is a problem,\" she told reporters.Days before she had been accused of desecrating the national flag after she was caught on camera resting her bare feet on a table in front of the Indian colours. Earlier that month, she had also drawn the ire of Muslim groups after she filmed an advert at a historic mosque in her hometown, Hyderabad.In 2010, Mirza married Pakistani cricket player Shoaib Malik, prompting frequent questions about her loyalty to the country of her birth.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mirza, pictured with with husband Shoaib Malik from Pakistan, often faced questions about her patriotismEventually, Mirza managed to do something seemingly impossible - transcend these differences to become a South Asian icon instead of just an Indian one.On Tuesday, her fans in the Dubai arena and online cheered her on as she hugged her son after the match. It\\'s a testament to how Mirza managed unapologetically to dismantle notions about what she should or shouldn\\'t do.In a country where women have been discouraged from building a professional career in sport, Mirza managed to do exactly that - and so much more. When Rajdeep Sardesai, one of India\\'s most respected journalists, asked her about \"settling down\" during an interview in 2016, she chided him for \"sounding disappointed I\\'m not choosing motherhood over being number one in the world\". \"That\\'s the question I face all the time as a woman, that all women have to face - the first is marriage and then it\\'s motherhood. Unfortunately, that\\'s when we\\'re settled, and no matter how many Wimbledons we win,\" she said.Through her time in public life, Mirza\\'s been a vocal advocate of women\\'s rights, routinely speaking against domestic violence, sexual assault and other issues. She\\'s also been an incessant critic of the unfair standards in Indian sport, where good facilities and fair pay are still hard to come by for women. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mirza\\'s tennis career may have come to an end but the impact of her legacy as a sportswoman is far from overSome see her cool, hard-talking attitude as arrogance. For her fans, her outspokenness was golden.\"I would like people to remember that this girl fought for the right things. She believed in herself when nobody else did,\" she told ESPN, days before her retirement. \"She always thought that you can fight the odds.\"Mirza\\'s tennis career may have come to an end but her legacy as a sportswoman looks far from over.Apart from her tennis academies in Dubai and Hyderabad, she will be mentoring women cricketers of the Royal Challengers Bangalore franchise who will soon be playing in the Indian Women\\'s Premier League.\"The thought process is to try and help the next generation and try and find the answer to that question I\\'m asked all the time - \\'Who will come after you, that we have not been able to find for the last 20 years?\"Read more India stories from the BBC:MPs call BBC India office searches \\'intimidation\\' Pay cut shock for new hires at India IT giantBjorn Borg leaves India event as minister runs lateAnger over parole for Indian guru jailed for rapeA tycoonâ\\x80\\x99s wealth woes and Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s green energy dreams The young Anglo-Indians retracing their European rootsRelated TopicsAsiaIndiaMore on this storyIndian star Mirza aims to inspire31 August 2015New mum Mirza to return to tennis28 November 2019Top StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

Now, Kyiv\\'s soldiers are in the UK learning how to operate them.Some, like Sasha, are battle hardened. He\\'s been fighting in eastern Ukraine. But he is swapping his old Russian T-80 tank for the British Army\\'s Challenger 2. His friend, Grisha, was just driving tractors until a few months ago. Now they\\'re both learning to drive a 60-tonne tank - much heavier and more sophisticated than anything they\\'ve been used to. The British Army\\'s Challenger 2 may be more than 20 years old, but both Sasha and Grisha see it as a vast improvement on Ukraine\\'s older and lighter Soviet-era tanks. Sasha raves about its suspension and manoeuvrability, and easy access to the engine. The driver is also the mechanic. But he particularly likes the fact that inside there\\'s a very British piece of kit to heat water for cups of tea. He says his old tank didn\\'t have such creature comforts. Grisha\\'s focused on their main purpose. He says Western tanks, like the Challenger 2, are exactly the kind of weapons Ukraine needs to win this war.Image caption, Sasha says these weapons are what Ukraine needsBritain is giving Ukraine just 14 Challenger 2s. But other nations are now following the UK\\'s lead in providing Ukraine with Western main battle tanks. In all, at least 11 countries have now pledged to do the same, though it\\'s still not clear how many will be delivered or when they\\'ll arrive. Some nations have refused to discuss numbers. Soldiers like Sasha and Grisha have been at a British Army base in Dorset for the past few weeks - driving training vehicles rather than the ones that will eventually be delivered to Ukraine. The Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and the head of the Army, General Sir Patrick Sanders, were among the VIPs to visit them to assess their progress. Mr Wallace says it\\'s not just about learning to drive and fire the Challenger, but how to \"weave them together\" with armoured vehicles and artillery to create \"a combined arms effect\". Image caption, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace joins Ukrainian soldiers and their British trainersIn other words, how to use them for offensive operations to take back ground from Russia. Posing for a photograph with grateful Ukrainian soldiers on top of a Challenger, Mr Wallace points to the distance and says \"Crimea that way!\". He jokes that it\\'s more motivation than \"a two-hour speech\" in what sounds like a jibe at President Putin\\'s latest address. As well as the 14 UK Challenger tanks, Britain is also providing Ukraine with 20 Bulldog armoured troop carriers and 30 AS-90 self-propelled artillery guns.When we visit, Ukrainian soldiers are already wielding wrenches and tools - showing they\\'re learning fast to keep them maintained. One of their British trainers, Lance Corporal Zach Reid of the King\\'s Royal Hussars says the Ukrainians have shown they\\'re \"very bright, with technical skills which makes it easy to instruct\". He also believes the arrival of the Challenger 2 could be a \"game changer\" with its heavier armour, its night sights and thermal imaging. Few Russian tanks have the same. The British Army has, in theory, 227 Challenger 2 tanks. In reality fewer than half that number are fit for battle. Built in the late 1990s some are likely to have been cannibalized for spare parts no longer manufactured. But Ben Wallace signals that he could still send more. The head of the Army, General Sir Patrick Sanders, has admitted that just sending 14 tanks has \"temporarily weakened\" the British Army. Mr Wallace himself is pressing the Treasury for more money. He notes that 20 of 30 Nato members have promised to increase their defence spending since Russia\\'s invasion. Britain so far has not. But Mr Wallace\\'s immediate focus is on helping Ukraine win this war, even if it means raiding his own stocks and supplies. As to the question \\'could Ukraine be sent more British made tanks?\\', he says \"I\\'d be open to giving more if we think that\\'s the right thing to do\".Image caption, The soldiers will spend the next few weeks training before returning to UkraineFor Sasha and Grisha the next few weeks will involve more training - including learning how to fire the Challenger 2\\'s 120mm rifled gun. The tanks they use are being fitted out elsewhere for battle - including replacing communications systems. Getting them to Ukraine will present another logistics challenge. They\\'re too heavy and big to be flown to Poland by aircraft. But there is a sense of urgency to get them to the front - in time for an expected Ukrainian spring offensive. Britain was the first Western nation to pledge main battle tanks to Ukraine. It wants to be the first to see their tanks join the battle.

Pictures showed a heavy lifting machine picking up the huge sphere.Local officials in Hamamatsu said that it will be stored \"for a certain period of time\" then \"disposed of\". But many have also questioned why Japanese officials have not come out and clearly said what it is.Interest in the object - dubbed \"Godzilla egg\", \"mooring buoy\" and \"from outer space\" - started earlier this week after a local alerted police upon noticing the unusual object on the shore.Police, and even a bomb squad, were sent to check out the object.Authorities cordoned off the area and conducted X-ray exams which did not reveal much more - other than confirming the object was safe.Now it has been removed. \"I think everyone in Hamamatsu City was worried and curious about what it was about, but I\\'m relieved that the work is over,\" a local official told Japanese media. Many also questioned on social media why Japanese officials have not explained what it is. Others have voiced embarrassment at the whole episode. \"I can\\'t believe officials from a country surrounded by ocean don\\'t recognise a ball buoy,\" read one tweet. \"OMG! It\\'s a steel mooring buoy people. I\\'m embarrassed to be Japanese,\" said another.Hamamatsu\\'s local civil engineering office said it \"considers it to be a foreign-made buoy\". Prof Mark Inall, an oceanographer at the Scottish Association for Marine Science, said he knew what it was \"instantly\". \"It\\'s very recognisable,\" he told the BBC. \"We use (them) to keep instruments floating in the ocean.\"They often wash up on the coast of Scotland, he added.While Professor Inall said he was surprised that the metal sphere was not identified more quickly, he acknowledged that the general public wouldn\\'t necessarily have known what it was. \"It could be confused for a World War 2 mine ... but those would have spikes sticking out of them,\" he said.He added that the objects can float in the ocean for decades, and can lose their markings and get rusty when they wash ashore. The buoys can break free from their anchorage either in a violent storm or from being pulled by a big fishing vessel, Professor Inall said. The Japanese authorities\\' response to the metal sphere was as curious as the object itself. The mysterious ball washed up amid a heightened sense of nervousness here. Last week Japanese media was discussing the ramifications of North Korea\\'s recent missile activity. On Saturday an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) landed in Japan\\'s territorial waters. On Monday, North Korea fired two ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan after the United States held joint exercises with East Asian allies. Balloon saga deflates efforts to mend US-China relationsThere\\'s also the issue of China\\'s spy balloons. On Wednesday, Japanese and Chinese officials held security meetings in Tokyo for the first time in four years, where Japan expressed concern about the surveillance balloons. Last week the government here said at least three unidentified flying objects spotted over its territorial skies between 2019 and 2021 were \"strongly suspected\" to have been Chinese. Beijing denied allegations of espionage and urged Tokyo to stop following Washington\\'s lead in exaggerating Chinese threats. Given this tense undercurrent of geopolitical events and perceived threats from its neighbours, the flurry of speculation in Japan is understandable. \"Given the recent events ... I could understand there\\'s an interest in an unidentified floating object,\" Professor Inall said.Related TopicsJapanMore on this storyMystery sphere found on beach perplexes Japan2 days agoBalloon saga deflates efforts to mend US-China relations6 FebruaryTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

North Korea last tested a nuclear bomb in 2017 - the most powerful of six tests conducted at Punggye-ri.It said the tests were conducted safely, but scientists have long raised fears that radioactive material might have escaped into the surrounding soil and groundwater. North Korean defectors, who once lived near the site, have previously reported seeing strange illnesses in their communities, but scientists have not been able to establish a link. Authorities in Seoul are now inviting all North Koreans, who escaped from nearby towns near the site, to be tested for signs of radiation. Nuclear experts the BBC spoke to largely agree with the possibility of nuclear contamination laid out in TJWG\\'s report but say its extent will be hard to determine.Nuclear radiation can damage living cells partially or completely, sometimes resulting in cancer. As with most toxins, the risks associated with radioactive materials depend on the amount of exposure.The Ministry of Unification, an executive department in South Korea promoting Korean reunification, stopped testing defectors for radiation exposure in 2019. Nine of the 40 defectors tested in 2017 and 2018 showed \"worrying levels\" of genetic abnormalities, the group said in its report. While the TJWG did not directly attribute these to radiation exposure, it noted higher radiation doses for those who showed more abnormalities. In particular, the TJWG flagged the leakage of radioactive materials into groundwater as a particular concern, given people\\'s growing tendency to consume groundwater.North Korea\\'s 2008 census data shows that a sixth of households in the northernmost province of North Hamgyong, where Punggye-ri is located, use groundwater as drinking and agricultural water. This proportion is likely to have gone up due to a chronic shortage of electricity across the country. Electricity is supplied only on a part-time basis even in the capital Pyongyang, which is always prioritised in resource allocation.What we know about N Korea\\'s missile and nuclear programmeWargaming a North Korean attackHow dangerous is the situation in North Korea?North Korea\\'s weapons programme has accelerated under leader Kim Jong Un, who said in September 2022 that his country\\'s nuclear weapons were no longer designed just to prevent war, but could also be used pre-emptively and offensively, to win a war.\"North Korea\\'s rulers have sought to maximise international interest in its nuclear capabilities while avoiding attention on its human rights issues. There is in fact a tendency to view the North Korean nuclear issue solely from a security perspective,\" said the authors of the TJWG\\'s report.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Satellite photo of North Korea\\'s Punggye-ri nuclear test siteUnlike the US and Russia, which conducted nuclear tests in the early days, North Korea is fairly new to them, said freelance energy journalist Chris Cragg.\"The very odd thing is that North Korea keeps on upping its tests to keep on reminding the world that it has the technology, as a political gesture rather than a technical one. The rest of the world has largely abandoned testing because they know how such bombs actually work.\"Mark Diesendorf, an energy policy researcher at the University of New South Wales, said the high radiation doses in the defectors reported by TJWG - about 100 times the global average of natural background radiation - is likely to increase the risk of cancers in those exposed. But he questioned how those doses were measured or estimated.Underground tests are not very effective in containing radiation, he noted.Scott Snyder, a senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council for Foreign Relations, said the history of nuclear testing around the world had drawn a \"pretty consistent linkage between radiation exposure and public health impact on proximate populations\".It is \"not surprising\" that the health and environmental impact would be underappreciated or go unaddressed in North Korea, he added.The TJWG said neighbouring countries like South Korea, China, and Japan might also be at risk because of the smuggling and distribution of agricultural and marine products, as well as North Korean specialities like pine mushrooms, from areas close to Punggye-ri.The group called out the governments of these countries for not doing enough to guard their populations against these risks.It noted that the South Korean government had come under criticism in 2018 for giving away pine mushrooms that its then-President Moon Jae-in received as a gift from Kim Jong Un to about 4,000 elderly families - reportedly without testing them for radiation.Chinese authorities have also failed to stop the smuggling of North Korea\\'s agricultural and marine products within China or to a third country, it alleged. The group has urged South Korean and Chinese authorities to disclose results of past tests, for radiation exposure. It is also calling for an international inquiry into the radiation risks for communities around Punggye-ri.Related TopicsNuclear safety and securityAsiaNorth Korea weapons programmeSouth KoreaNorth KoreaTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4\\'s Thought of the Day segment, Justin Welby said: \"There must be a future with a just and stable peace - a free and secure Ukraine - and the beginning of a generation\\'s long process of healing and reconciliation.\" The British Ambassador to Ukraine, Dame Melinda Simmons, has recalled how the outbreak of the war last February was \"such a traumatic time\".Dame Melinda told BBC Radio 4\\'s Woman\\'s Hour programme her role became different and stopped being a job and became \"a life because war isn\\'t just a five-day thing\".Meanwhile, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has announced fresh export bans on goods that could be used by the Russian military.Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said sanctions have been extended to more products, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components.Bosses at Russia\\'s two largest defence companies and four banks will also face sanctions.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: Emotional Dame Helen Mirren tears up reciting poem for UkraineDuring a recent tour of Europe, President Zelensky increased his calls for Western nations to supply modern fighter jets. The UK is to start training Ukrainian forces to fly Nato-standard aircraft. But like other Western nations, it has so far not supplied jets, but said it remains a long-term option.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the UK would be \"very happy\" to supply fighter jets to eastern European allies so they could release their Soviet-era planes to Ukraine. He said they were already being used by Kyiv and it would be a faster way of boosting Ukraine defencesthan suppling British Typhoon jets.

On Thursday, Health Minister Mam Bunheng said it was the first known human infection of the H5N1 strain in Cambodia since 2014. The girl had been taken from her village to the children\\'s hospital in capital Phnom Penh - but died shortly after her diagnosis.Officials have collected samples of several dead birds from near the girl\\'s village. Health officials have also warned residents against touching dead or sick birds.Cambodia last recorded a bird flu case in 2014. In the decade before, it recorded 56 human cases of H5N1 infection, 37 of which were fatal.Human cases of bird flu are rare, as humans do not have the receptors in their throats, noses, and upper respiratory tracts that are susceptible to the current virus strain. People who work with infected poultry are at higher risk of being infected. WHO has recorded eight cases human H5N1 infections since 2021, including in China, India, Spain, the UK and US.A new, highly contagious strain of the virus is infecting birds around the world.The recent bird flu outbreak has been circling the globe since October 2021.The World Organisation for Animal Health told the BBC earlier this month that it had recorded almost 42 million individual cases in domestic and wild birds.Almost 15 million domestic birds, including poultry, have died from the disease, and more than 193 million more have been culled.The strain had also infected mammals, such as minks and otters. The World Health Organization said earlier this month that the virus will \"need to be monitored closely\" to see if it is mutating into a form which can spread among humans.Related TopicsAsiaCambodiaMore on this storyWhy is bird flu so bad this year?2 FebruaryBird flu \\'spills over\\' to otters and foxes in UK2 FebruaryTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

We liked what we saw,\" Olesia told the BBC through an interpreter. \"But what I can really say is that there are many heartfelt people here, and that it\\'s safe.\" The couple fled the city of Dnipro almost exactly a year ago after Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February 2022. Shortly thereafter, they travelled to Italy, where the pair and their two young children took shelter in a dormitory alongside more than 100 people. In December, however, they became part of the approximately 109,000 refugees who have found a new home in the US through Uniting For Ukraine, a government programme that allows Americans to sponsor Ukrainians to come to the US for up to two years. The programme, which has been considered a resounding success, has led to the Biden administration announcing similar initiatives for refugees from other countries.Under Uniting for Ukraine, sponsors are supposed to help provide financial support for basic needs such as housing and health care, but participants and activists say the initiative has led to bonds being formed between refugees and their sponsors that often go far beyond their initial commitments. \"We regularly hear it is life changing, and a very powerful experience. It\\'s a tremendously powerful gift of safety and security,\" said Anya McMurray, the president and chief operating officer of Welcome.Us, an online platform that connects sponsors and refugees. \"It is every bit as transformative for the welcomer as it is for those being welcomed,\" she added. \\'Everyone is kind, but the fact is, we\\'re not home\\'Ukrainians adjust to Manx life after fleeing warMs McMurray\\'s assessment was echoed by John Schrager, the Minnesota-based lawyer who sponsored Olesia and Serhii along with several friends.\"I got a new Ukrainian family out of it,\" Mr Schrager said. \"And - luck of the draw - I happened to sponsor someone who\\'s an amazing cook!\"Image source, John SchragerImage caption, Serhii and Olesia (centre) with John Schrager and an interpreter at his Minnesota homeAnother US sponsor, Alabama-based Kelly Wheeler, told the BBC that what began as a small family effort to help a Ukrainian woman and her young son soon ballooned into a sprawling group effort involving many other people. Together, Ms Wheeler and other residents of the town of Madison were able to provide financial support, as well as other donations and even furniture, until the refugees were settled. \"There\\'s been so much support from our community, our church and our neighbourhood,\" she said. \"You don\\'t do it aloneâ\\x80¦.all it took was a little bit of advertising and getting the word out.\" Missing Home The woman Ms Wheeler supported, Viktoriia Kuznietsova, is originally from the occupied city of Melitopol in Ukraine\\'s south-east. She was forced to abandon a law career after Russia invaded, and first fled to Israel before ultimately arriving in the US in June. Accompanying her was her young son, 7-year-old Artem. In Alabama, she has found a job as a cashier at a local supermarket.\"I really like it, and it\\'s a new experience,\" she added. \"People are very friendly. They ask me where I\\'m from and things about me, and about my country.\"While she\\'s now safely thousands of miles away from Ukraine with her son, Ms Kuznietsova added that her thoughts constantly drift back to her country. Image source, Welcome.USImage caption, Kelly Wheeler with Viktoriia Kuznietsova and their familiesOver the winter, she teamed up with other Russian and Ukrainian-speakers in Alabama to raise money for packages to help the war effort in Ukraine, where her brother is now a soldier fighting on the frontlines. \"I think so much about my brother. He\\'s in dangerous territory, in Donetsk,\" she said. \"All day I worry about the rest of my family. They\\'re in occupied territory.\"More to Come The success of Uniting for Ukraine has led to similar initiatives for refugees from other countries.The Biden administration recently announced that sponsors could help bring in 30,000 people a month from Nicaragua, Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela for a period of up to two years.In January, the Biden administration created a new programme, Welcome Corps, which seeks to mobilise 10,000 Americans to help 5,000 refugees from around the globe come to the US. Inspired by previous programmes for Ukrainians and Afghans, as well as a similar sponsorship programme in neighbouring Canada that has so far resettled 368,000 people, Welcome Corps allows groups of five or more Americans to raise a minimum of $2,375 in cash and in-kind contributions, which will then be used to provide for a refugee\\'s initial needs until they\\'re able to find a job.In contrast to the previous programmes, Welcome Corps allows approved refugees to connect directly through sponsors, rather than through resettlement agencies. \\'Every Ukrainian has a battlefield - the stage is ours\\'My nights are peaceful at last, after air raids trauma in Ukraine\"We\\'re thrilled,\" Ms McMurray told the BBC. \"We think it\\'s exactly the right direction, because it taps into the will, desire and capacity of Americans to welcome.\"Also unlike previous US programmes, including Uniting For Ukraine, Welcome Corps provides a pathway to citizenship after five years. Jocelyn Wyatt, the CEO of Alight - a humanitarian organisation that has previously helped pair refugees with Americans - said the new programme benefited sponsors and refugees.\"It opens up so many opportunities for everyday Americans to be really generous, be welcoming and be able to provide support and a soft-landing for people who are coming into this country,\" she said. Sponsoring a refugee, however, is not without its challenges.

On Wednesday, Rondong Sinmun wrote that \"imperialists\" used aid as a \"trap to plunder and subjugate\" recipient countries.South Korea\\'s unification ministry has reportedly also sounded the alarm on the food shortages and asked the World Food Programme (WFP) for help.Satellite imagery from South Korean authorities shows that the North produced 180,000 tonnes less food in 2022 than in 2021.In June, the WFP raised concerns that extreme weather conditions like drought and flooding could reduce production of both winter and spring crops. State media also reported late last year that the country was experiencing its \"second worst\" drought on record.As forecasted, food prices have risen this year amid poor harvests and people have been turning to inexpensive alternatives, said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, who works with North Korea-centred publication 38North.org.The price of corn has risen 20% at the start of 2023, with growing demand for the less preferred - compared to rice - but more affordable staple, reported Rimjin-gang, a North Korean magazine based in Japan.\"If people are buying more corn it means food overall is getting more expensive, and staple foods like rice in particular,\" Mr Silberstein said. A kilogram of the crop now costs about 3,400 North Korean won (Â£3.10 $3.80).North Korea is ranked one of the poorest countries in the world. Recent estimates are scarce, but CIA World Factbook estimates its gross domestic product per capita to be around $1,700 in 2015.N Korea slams South\\'s \\'absurd\\' offer of aidWhy doesn\\'t North Korea have enough food?That said, the actual situation and numbers are unclear, given North Korea\\'s opaque economy.\"Due to North Korea\\'s strict Covid border measures on goods and people, there\\'s no way for any outsiders to go into the country and check for themselves what the situation is,\" said James Fretwell, an analyst at NK News.People take part in an annual rice planting event in Nampho City in Chongsan-ri, near Nampho on May 12, 2019Image source, KIM WON JINImage caption, A file photo shows North Koreans taking part in an annual rice planting event in Nampho city in 2019These measures have also made it difficult for organisations outside North Korea to send help in times of crisis, he added.North Korea has also strictly restricted cross-border trade and traffic since January 2020.Sokeel Park, South Korea country director in non-profit Liberty in North Korea (Link), described the regime\\'s response to the pandemic as \"extreme and paranoid\".Mr Park, whose organisation helps resettle North Korean refugees in South Korea or the US, said the supply of basic necessities in the North has been dwindling since the start of the pandemic. Link has heard multiple credible reports of people starving to death, Mr Park said.The country has also seen a significant decline in humanitarian aid from the international community - the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said North Korea received $2.3m (Â£1.9m) from international organisations and other agencies last year, down from $14m in 2021.While this may be a result of prolonged border closures, some relief workers told the BBC that international sanctions, which have tightened in response to North Korea\\'s military provocations, have also hindered the delivery of humanitarian supplies.Still, there are some signs that cross-border economic activity is starting again. Nikkei Asia reported last week that some truck travel with China, which accounts for over 90% of North Korea\\'s trade, has resumed.But that does not necessarily mean standards of living will improve for ordinary North Koreans.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Much of North Korea\\'s spending goes on the military - its latest missile launchers were displayed earlier in FebruaryMuch of North Korea\\'s spending goes on the military - its latest missile launchers were displayed earlier in FebruaryMr Park said the regime has focused its resources on its missile prowess and propaganda, at high social costs. Pyongyang fired a record number of ballistic missiles last year - more than 70, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, which can potentially reach the US mainland. Early this month, it showed off its largest-ever display of ICBMs at a military parade.\"The regime has acknowledged how hard things are for ordinary North Korean people, but continues to prioritise propaganda and pageantry for the Kim family, missile launches, and strict controls [on] the population,\" Mr Park added.Experts worry that the situation on the ground will deteriorate further, leading to a famine as devastating as the one the country experienced in the mid-to-late 1990s, often known in official documents as the \"Arduous March\". Estimates put the number of deaths between 600,000 to a million.\"We don\\'t seem to be near the levels of the 1990s famine,\" Mr Silberstein said. \"But margins are razor thin. So even a slightly lessened supply of food could potentially have dire consequences.\"Related TopicsKim Jong-unAsiaNorth KoreaMore on this storyNorth Korea parades largest long-range missile array9 FebruaryAs winter looms, reports of starvation in North Korea5 November 2021N Korea\\'s Kim warns of crisis amid famine threat9 April 2021Top StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

When photographer Tariq Zaidi visited North Korea late last year he tried to capture candid family moments between parents and children.I travelled to eight out of North Korea's nine provinces and along the way visited schools, nurseries and music academies. Not many outsiders get a chance to visit the country and for those who do, taking pictures is highly restricted and controlled. These are images I was permitted to take by North Korean minders, and they offer a few glimpses into what it's like to grow up in the closed-off and isolated country. My journey took me from Dandong on the Chinese border in the north down to Kaesong at the border with South Korea, across the country from Pyongyang to Wonsan on the east coast and then north again towards Chongjin and Hoeryong near the Chinese-Russian border.While this selection of images cannot claim to be comprehensive, I did get some sense of the cultural and social environment and aspirations for the children we came into contact with. Whenever we went to a town, we tried to visit a school. There are many different kinds of schools in North Korea and a lot of the sightseeing outside of museums involved visiting municipal institutions like that. Image source, Tariq ZaidiImage caption, This young girl plays a traditional Korean drum at the Hoeryong Schoolchildren's PalaceImage source, Tariq ZaidiImage caption, Mothers play on a slide with their children in a central Pyongyang playgroundA lot of the students wanted to show off how well they spoke English and at some schools tourists were encouraged to speak to their top students who spoke the best English about whatever we wanted. A lot of the conversation was general knowledge exchanges on any issue, for example The Beatles. It felt surprising because one would assume a frank exchange wouldn't be welcome but these environments felt open. At the same time, you realise you are in North Korea and this is the school we were taken to and a conversation in another part of the world might go very differently.Imagine a North Korean family...The North Korean women who had to escape twiceTears and joy as Korean families reuniteImage source, Tariq ZaidiImage caption, A girl studying at the North Hamgyong province library in ChongjinImage source, Tariq ZaidiImage caption, A mother and child walk around in PyongyangSome of the schools we were taken to see had mind bogglingly state-of-the-art facilities for the most talented students. We were told they were called schoolchildren's palaces. Obviously there will be many other kinds of schools, but we weren't taken to see them.The emphasis on sport, music, culture was really noticeable. A lot of students were eager to take on the tourists, to have serious competitive games of football and basketball, for example.But outside of the official guided visits to set destinations, there were those journeys where I could capture candid and spontaneous shots: a father cuddling his child on the metro, a mother playing with her children on a playground while I sped by on a bus. They didn't even know I was there.But moments like those help to illustrate an obvious but important point - that no matter what kind of rule you find yourself under, families end up pretty much the same and children at school in North Korea have personal goals and ambitions like everybody else.

Hypersonic missiles fly at several times the speed of sound and at low altitude, to escape radar detection. It ended 2022 by firing three short-range ballistic missiles towards the sea, a few days after flying five drones into South Korea\\'s airspace.In November last year, an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested at a high angle, short-range trajectory. Launched at a lower trajectory, this same missile could have reached the US mainland, according to the Japanese government.Images from North Korean state media of Kim Jong-un with his daughter at the launch appear to show it was the Hwasong-17 - or possibly a modified version of it.Unveiled in October 2020, the missile is believed to have a range of 15,000km or more, and could potentially carry three or four warheads, rather than only one.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Missiles on display at a January 2021 military paradeSeveral earlier attempts to launch the Hwasong-17 are thought to have failed, although it may have been used in a test carried out in March 2022.In October last year, North Korea fired another type of missile which flew over Japan - thought to have been the intermediate-range Hwasong-12. This can travel up to 4,500km - putting the US island of Guam in the Pacific within range.North Korea has also been testing the Hwasong-14 ballistic missile with a range of 8,000km - although some studies suggest it could travel as far as 10,000km, making it capable of reaching New York.And there is the Hwasong-15 missile, which is believed to have a range of 13,000km, putting all of the continental US in its sights.The unveiling of the new missiles appeared to be a message to the Biden administration of the North\\'s growing military prowess, say experts.\"North Korea has been testing missiles with longer and longer ranges,\" says Joseph Byrne, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.\"It could be the precursor to it testing another nuclear warhead, which has been predicted for some time,\" he adds.In March 2021, it carried out a launch of what it called a \"new-type tactical guided projectile\", which it said was able to carry a payload of 2.5 tons - so capable in theory of carrying a nuclear warhead. Analysts at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies told Reuters that it appeared to be \"an improved variant\" of a previously tested missile, the KN-23. What nuclear weapons does North Korea have?The last time North Korea tested a nuclear bomb was in 2017. The explosion at its Punggye-ri test site had a force, or \"yield\", of between 100-370 kilotons. A 100 kiloton bomb is six times more powerful than the one the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.North Korea claimed this was its first thermonuclear device - the most powerful of all types of atomic weapon.However, North Korea may now be aiming to test a smaller type of nuclear warhead with similar explosive force, according to Mr Byrne. \"It seems they are now testing a new capability - a miniaturised warhead that can be fitted onto a range of missiles, including short-range missiles\" he says. Six underground tests have previously been carried out at Punggye-ri. However, in 2018 North Korea said it would shut the site down, because it had \"verified\" its nuclear capabilities.Some of the tunnels into the site were subsequently blown up in the presence of foreign journalists. However, North Korea did not invite international experts to verify if it had been put beyond use.Satellite images released in March this year suggest work to renovate Punggye-ri had started.Any future nuclear testing at the site would breach resolutions from the United Nations Security Council.Restarting North Korea\\'s nuclear reactorIn 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made a promise to then-US president Donald Trump that North Korea would destroy all its nuclear material enrichment facilities.However, the UN\\'s atomic energy agency, the IAEA, says satellite images suggest that North Korea had restarted the reactor which makes its weapons-grade plutonium.In September 2022, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said there were signs that a nuclear test site was open again.He added: \"We have observed indications of the operation of facilities and of construction work at the Yongbyon site, as well as activities at other locations.\" The IAEA has not had physical access to North Korea\\'s nuclear facilities since April 2009.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsRelated TopicsNorth Korea weapons programmeReality CheckNorth KoreaMore on this storyNorth Korea unveils new submarine-launched missile15 January 2021US report urges space missile defence17 January 2019North Korea \\'unlikely to abandon nukes\\'30 January 2019Korean soldiers cross border in peace13 December 2018Kim Jong-un warns of \\'change in direction\\'1 January 2019North Korea\\'s sidelined human rights crisis18 February 2019Top StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

Here are some of the things we spotted from an annual tradition that has been described as \"endearingly awkward\". 1. Brendan Fraser having a \\'whale\\' of a time Image source, Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences Image caption, Brendan Fraser, centre left beside costume designer Ruth CarterEveryone loves a good comeback story, but even the best screenwriter couldn\\'t have written a better story arc for Brendan Fraser. After all but disappearing from the big screen in the mid-noughties, Fraser is the frontrunner for this year\\'s Best Actor nomination for his portrayal of Charlie, in The Whale. Director Darren Aronofsky is said to have spent nearly a decade searching for the right actor to portray the reclusive English teacher who struggles with severe obesity and is desperate to reconnect with his estranged daughter. Critics lauded Fraser\\'s emotional tour-de-force alongside co-stars Sadie Sink and Hong Chau, who is also nominated for Best Supporting Actress. 2. The Daniels look bemusedImage source, Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences Image caption, The Daniels, Daniel Scheinert (yellow jacket) and Daniel Kwan (red beanie) looking bemusedIn a parallel dimension, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, the directing duo behind multiverse movie Everything Everywhere All at Once, are probably smiling in the yearbook photo. But in this version, they look bemused.Perhaps that\\'s because their zany, martial arts opus has become this year\\'s unlikely frontrunner. The film has won 11 nominations, including a historic best actress nod for Michelle Yeoh. She is the first Asian-identifying actress to be nominated in the category. 3. All smiles from the Emerald IsleImage source, Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences A beaming Brendan Gleeson - the co-star alongside Colin Farrell in tragicomedy The Banshees of Inisherin - sums up why Irish eyes are smiling at the Oscars this year.Nearly a quarter of this year\\'s actor nominees are Irish, according to the LA Times, and The Quiet Girl is also Ireland\\'s first nomination for an International Feature Film. 4. A great year for newcomers and first-timers Image source, Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences In the past, awards shows have been criticised for seemingly nominating the same actors every year - Meryl Streep, for example, has been nominated 21 times. But not this year. Sixteen of the 20 actors nominated are would-be first-time winners, according to the LA Times.That includes Austin Butler, who is nominated for his spot-on portrayal of Elvis Presley. Mere days after Butler took home the Golden Globe for Best Actor, Elvis\\'s daughter, Lisa Marie, died suddenly. Butler said her passing has made this awards season \"bittersweet\" and he hopes to win for both Presley and her family. 5. Costume designers are on point Image source, Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences Image caption, Shirley Kurata was the costume designer for Everything Everywhere All at OnceCostume designers are among the unsung heroes of the film world, but who would Elvis be without his bedazzled jumpsuit or Queen Ramonda without her glorious crown? This year\\'s nominated designers helped create characters who travelled the multiverse, fought for Wakanda and revelled in the decadence of early Hollywood. Costume designer Shirley Kurata is nominated for Everything Everywhere All at Once. 6. Do I spy Mr Bean?Image source, Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences It\\'s not every day you see Mr Bean on the red carpet. Director Shaunak Sen decided to keep things casual in his class photo. His film All That Breathes is nominated for best documentary feature. The story follows two brothers in New Delhi who try to rescue black kites, majestic birds who are dying because of the crowded city\\'s toxic skies. 7. Avatar is (finally) back Image source, Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences Sometimes, it feels like it\\'s been 84 years since Avatar premiered (That\\'s a Titanic/James Cameron joke). But all that waiting appears to have paid off. Avatar: The Way of the Water is nominated for Best Picture, which is perhaps why its Julian Howarth (centre, dark shirt, grey blazer), who is also nominated for his sound design on the film, looks so chuffed. And while it\\'s rare for a summer blockbuster to be nominated for Best Picture, two of the highest-grossing films of the year are up for the top honour: Avatar: The Way of the Water and Top Gun: Maverick. 8. Tom is cruising to new heights Image source, Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences Speaking of Maverick, there\\'s Tom Cruise with his signature dazzling grin. Apparently today\\'s event was slightly delayed because everyone seemed to want their photo with the mega star. First-time nominee Ke Huy Quan was reportedly jumping with joy to get a selfie with Cruise. â\\x80\\x9cI want a picture with this man!

It\\'s Cruise\\'s first nominated film in 23 years. 9. Angela Bassett looks as flawless as ever Image source, Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences Tom Cruise and Angela Bassett also had a mini-Mission Impossible reunion. Bassett starred alongside Cruise in the sixth installment of the franchise: Mission Impossible: Fallout. Bassett is nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Queen Ramonda in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. She is the first actor to be nominated for a Marvel film. Bassett was last nominated for Best Actress in the 1994 Tina Turner biopic, What\\'s Love Got to Do With It. 10. It\\'s Jamie Lee Curtis\\' time to shineImage source, Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences Although she\\'s been acting since the late 70s, this year marks the first time Jamie Lee Curtis has been nominated for an Oscar. She admitted to Parade that she felt \"totally shocked\" to be nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Deirdre Beaubeirdre in Everything Everywhere All at Once.Â\"I\\'m 64 years old. I\\'ve been an actor since I was 19,\" she toldÂAP Entertainment. \"I made horror films and sold yogurt. I never thought I would hear my name at the Oscars.\"The 95th Academy Awards ceremony takes place on 12 March 2023 in Hollywood, Los Angeles.Related TopicsThe OscarsMore on this storyOscars 2023: The nominations in full9 FebruaryOscars deeply impacted by racism, actress claims7 FebruaryChinese fans rejoice at Michelle Yeoh Oscar nod25 JanuaryMultiverse adventure leads 2023 Oscar nominations24 January10 things we spotted in the Oscars class photo28 January 2020Top StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

Analysts say such a number of the missiles - which can in theory hit as far as the US mainland - could potentially overwhelm US nuclear defences if each missile carried multiple war heads.North Korea\\'s media did not provide detail, but said such an arsenal demonstrated the country\\'s \"mighty war deterrence and counterattack capabilities\".Pictures published by North Korean media on Thursday morning appeared to show more than a dozen ICBMs rolling through the central square of Pyongyang - accompanied by an army of foot solders.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Missile launchers displayed at the paradeSome North Korea analysts said the display also included a new ICBM launcher which appeared designed to accommodate a solid-fuel missile. Solid-fuel missiles can be launched more quickly than liquid-fuel missiles, which are hard to defend against. However, Kim\\'s regime has never successfully tested long-range solid-fuel missiles.\"This is one of North Korea\\'s major nuclear modernisation goals,\" said Ankit Panda, a nuclear policy specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\"We should expect to see the first flight tests of longer-range solid fuel missiles in the coming months,\" he told the BBC.He added the expansion of North Korea\\'s ICBM arsenal presented potentially \"serious military planning challenges\" for the US in a conflict, as it would be difficult for the US to find and destroy all of North Korea\\'s mobile ICBMs.The parade comes after a record year of missile testing by North Korea in breach of UN economic sanctions. That has led to several flare-ups of tensions on the Korean peninsula.What missiles has North Korea been testing?What we can expect from Kim Jong-un in 2023Profile: Kim Jong-unThe state\\'s Korean Central News Agency reported the parade stressed the country\\'s ability to face down its enemies \"nuke for nuke, confrontation for confrontation\".Images published showed Mr Kim clad in a black coat and fedora inspecting rows of soldiers holding bayonets, and saluting as troops and missile units paraded past. He was also photographed observing the parade from a balcony with Ju-ae by his side.The elevation of Ju-ae - who is believed to be about 10 years old - has been another key talking point for observers.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Kim Ju-ae with her father Kim Jong-un and mother Ri Sol Ju at a banquetState media photographs showed her taking centre stage at a pre-parade banquet with military leaders, where she was seated in the centre between Mr Kim and his wife Ri Sol Ju, a spot usually given to her father.The trio were pictured smiling and flanked by top military commanders. Ms Ri was also seen wearing a necklace with a pendant in the shape of a Hwasong-17 ICBM, North Korea\\'s largest missile which was test-launched last year.While some analysts say this points to Ju-ae as Mr Kim\\'s heir apparent, others say the state may be portraying the North Korean leader as a \"family man\".\"The inclusion of Kim\\'s daughter in the banquet was difficult to miss. North Korea\\'s state propagandists are clearly try to portray Kim Jong-un as a family man, but the exclusion of his other reported daughter is curious,\" said Martyn Williams, a senior fellow at Stimson Center who focuses on North Korea.Kim Jong-un reportedly has at least three children, including an elder son and a younger daughter. Ju-ae is believed to be his second child.She only made her first appearance in public three months ago in November, when her father took her to the launch of a major ICBM launch.While succession positioning may ultimately be the case, it is \"too early\" to arrive at the conclusion, Mr Williams told the BBC.Mr Panda said Ju-ae\\'s prominence in recent months could indicate that Kim expects his country\\'s nuclear enterprise to become a multi-generational affair.

He was convicted of attacking an actress in a hotel room during a film festival in the city in February 2013. \"Please don\\'t sentence me to life in prison,\" the disgraced Hollywood star told the court. \"I don\\'t deserve it.\"More than 80 people have made rape and misconduct claims about Weinstein dating back as far as the late 1970s. The 70-year-old is already serving a 23-year prison sentence for a separate conviction in New York. Before Thursday\\'s sentencing, Weinstein maintained he was innocent and the victim of a \"set-up\".On 19 December, a Los Angeles jury convicted him of one count of rape and two counts of sexual assault involving an actress. The victim, known as Jane Doe 1 to protect her anonymity, spoke in court before the sentence was read.She recounted the trauma she had endured for \"many years\" since the assault. \"Before that night I was a very happy and confident woman,\" she said. \"Everything changed after the defendant brutally assaulted me. There is no prison sentence long enough to undo the damage.\" Weinstein, meanwhile, told Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lisa Lench he did not know the victim. \"I never raped or sexually assaulted Jane Doe 1,\" he said.He told the court there were \"so many things wrong\" with the case and too many \"loopholes\".Weinstein called his accuser an \"actress with the ability turn on her tears\". His attorneys - who had sought a three-year sentence for Weinstein - asked the judge to take into account his deteriorating health, his children and his \"generous\" donations to charity. Weinstein sat in court looking away for most of the time and did not react when the sentence was read, which came after the judge rejected a motion by defence lawyers for a new trial.He was acquitted during the same Los Angeles trial of sexual battery against another accuser. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on three other sexual assault counts, including one involving Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the wife of California Governor Gavin Newsom. A mistrial was declared. He is thought likely to appeal against the sentence. The Oscar-winning movie producer had been facing up to 18 years in prison in the Los Angeles case. He avoided a sentence of up to 24 years after a jury was unable to agree on whether Weinstein had planned the rape or whether the victim was \"particularly vulnerable\". How the Weinstein scandal has unfoldedIn 2020, Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison for rape and sexual assault against a production assistant in 2006 and an aspiring actress in 2013. He has appealed. The conviction was seen as a milestone in the #MeToo movement, which had shone a light on rampant sexual abuse and harassment in the film and television industry.

Now Beijing has given its firmest response yet - and it\\'s not something many in the West would like.In recent days, China has launched an assertive charm offensive, kicking off with top diplomat Wang Yi\\'s tour of Europe which culminated in a warm welcome by Vladimir Putin in Moscow.Beijing has released not one but two position papers - the first offering the Chinese solution to the war and the other outlining a plan for world peace. These largely retread the talking points China has reiterated in the past year, calling for respect for sovereignty (for Ukraine) and the protection of national security interests (for Russia), while opposing the use of unilateral sanctions (by the US). The West may come away unimpressed - but convincing them was never likely the main goal for Beijing.Firstly, it clearly seeks to position itself as a global peacemaker. An obvious clue about who it\\'s really trying to charm lies in one of its papers where it mentions engaging South East Asia, Africa and South America - the so-called Global South. In preaching an alternative vision to a US-led world order, it is wooing the rest of the globe which is watching to see how the West handles the Ukraine crisis.But another goal is to send a clear message to the US. \"There is an element of defiance,\" said Alexander Korolev, an expert in Sino-Russian ties with the University of New South Wales. \"It is signalling: \\'If things get ugly between us, I have someone to go to. Russia is not alone, which means that I will not be alone when there is a confrontationâ\\x80¦ don\\'t get comfortable in bullying me.\\'\"The timing, say observers, is a giveaway. Relations between the US and China have hit a new low, exacerbated by the spy balloon saga. Some have also questioned why China has made its big diplomatic push for Ukraine peace only now.\"China had ample opportunities to display leadership, it was invited early on to contribute to ending the warâ\\x80¦ If the goal was to truly display the image of a global leader, you don\\'t have to sit on the fence for one year and try to perform a diplomatic dance,\" said Dr Korolev.There was a third goal, and it could be seen in Mr Wang\\'s itinerary. By visiting France, Germany, Italy and Hungary, whose leaders China perceives as taking less of a hardline stance on Russia, Mr Wang may have been testing the waters to see if China could lure some of Europe into China\\'s orbit.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 secondsBeijing sees a \"logical convergence of interests\" with these countries, said Zhang Xin, an international political economy expert with the East China Normal University. \"It believes the US has hegemonic power, and that a large part of the Transatlantic world could benefit from detaching from that system.\"But whether China will succeed in that particular goal is questionable. Mr Wang\\'s speech at the Munich Security Conference where he criticised the US did not play well in a roomful of America\\'s staunchest allies and, according to diplomats, only spawned greater distrust of China\\'s true motives.His tour \"was a very overt push to say: \\'We don\\'t have problems with Europe, we have problems with the US, we can fix things with you Europeans and you need to understand that the US is leading you down a problematic road\\'\", said Andrew Small, a senior fellow specialising in Europe-China relations at the German Marshall Fund think tank.\"But I think in most places in Europe, this message doesn\\'t have much traction.\"The key question now is whether Beijing will live up to its word of making peace as it tightens its embrace of Russia. The US has warned this week that China was considering supplying lethal weapons to Russia, and that Chinese firms had already been supplying non-lethal dual-use technology - items which could have both civilian and military uses, such as drones and semi-conductors.Publicly China has reacted with angry rhetoric. But behind closed doors, Mr Wang made it clear to they will not provide weapons to Russia.Image source, EPAImage caption, Russian President Vladimir Putin warmly welcomed Mr Wang in MoscowAccording to Mr Borrell, Mr Wang had also asked: \"Why do you show concern for me maybe providing arms to Russia when you are providing arms to Ukraine?\" It is a revealing line, say observers, showing how Beijing still truly believes the West is to blame for fuelling the war. \"Sending weapons to any warring party is considered as further escalation - that is the position of the Chinese state so far,\" said Dr Zhang.There is scepticism that Beijing would supply weapons to Moscow, given how it runs counter to Chinese interests.Such a move would be seen by others as a clear escalation of the war, and would lead to sanctions and disruption of trade with the West - hugely damaging for China as the EU and US are among its top trading partners. It would also raise global tensions significantly and likely push US allies further into America\\'s embrace, stymieing Beijing\\'s aims at wooing some of them as it mounts a challenge against the US. What is more likely to happen, say observers, is that Beijing will continue or even step up indirect support, such as boosting economic trade which has provided a financial lifeline to Moscow, and abstaining from sanctions on Russia.What support is China giving Russia? What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?They may even supply more dual-use technology through third party states such as Iran or North Korea, according to Dr Small, so that they can lend support \"as deniably as possible\".But as the war drags on, the issue of giving lethal weapons will resurface, he warned. \"There hasn\\'t been a question yet on what kind of significant things China could be asked to do, because previously Russia didn\\'t need to resupply,\" said Dr Small. \"But they are hitting that juncture. How long is China willing to say to Russia it will not do it?\"Days before the outbreak of war in Ukraine, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin declared they had a \"friendship without limits\". A year on, China will have to answer the question of how far it would go for its special friend.Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warChinaRussiaUnited StatesMore on this storyChina\\'s war neutrality claim fades with Russia visit1 day agoTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

Hundreds of men - backed by helicopters, B52 bombers and an aircraft carrier task force - were mobilised to cut back the poplar.Six of the men who took part told the BBC about their part in the most dramatic gardening job in history.A small neutral camp called the Joint Security Area (JSA) lies on the border between North and South Korea, in the area known as the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ). Both were created under the terms of the armistice signed in 1953 which ended the Korean War. The JSA - also called Panmunjom, or the Truce Village - is where negotiations between both sides take place. Most recently, it was where US President Donald Trump stepped into North Korea, becoming the first US leader to do so. But in 1976, guards and soldiers from both sides could wander all around the small zone. North Koreans, South Koreans and US guards would mingle together.Koreas start clearing Joint Security AreaHow to dodge mines and snipers on the Korean borderBill Ferguson was just 18 years old in August 1976. He was part of the US army support group in the JSA, under the command of the popular Captain Arthur Bonifas.\"Capt Bonifas really wanted us to enforce the terms of the armistice,\" Mr Ferguson says. \"We were encouraged to intimidate the North Koreans into allowing the full freedom of movement within the JSA.\"At the time, US soldiers were only allowed to serve in the JSA if they were over six feet (1.83m) tall, Mr Ferguson says, as part of this intimidation. Image source, Bill FergusonImage caption, Men from North Korea and the US mingle in the JSA, with the Panmungak pavilion in the background\"We didn\\'t get along with them at all,\" Mr Ferguson remembers, although he admits that occasionally North Korean guards would trade propaganda from their country for Marlboro cigarettes. Strict rules limited the number of guards from both sides and the weapons they could carry. Troops from one side would try to antagonise the other, which often led to violence. While Mr Ferguson was there, one US guard had his arm broken by North Koreans after he accidentally drove his jeep behind their main building, the Panmungak pavilion.US Lieutenant David \"Mad Dog\" Zilka meanwhile encouraged men to go out on patrol carrying big sticks, to bang on the walls and windows of North Korean barracks and to use as weapons if need be. \"Zilka would take us out on these clandestine patrols,\" says Mike Bilbo, a platoon mate and friend of Bill Ferguson\\'s in the JSA. \"Once or twice we caught a North Korean where they weren\\'t supposed to be and kind of beat him up a little bit - not too bad.\"Mr Bilbo says these aggressive actions on both sides may have prompted the incident over the tree. \"But there\\'s just no cause for them to do what they did.\"Image source, Mike BilboImage caption, A sketch by Mike Bilbo in 1976 showing the Bridge of No Return separating North and South Korea, and the tree in the bottom left-hand cornerThe branches of the poplar obscured the view between a checkpoint and an observation post. A team of US and South Korean men were ordered to prune it back. On the first attempt, North Korea objected, claiming any landscaping work required permission from both parties. Heavy rain thwarted the second try. Capt Bonifas - in the final days of his deployment in Korea - decided to monitor the third attempt personally, on 18 August.A group of North Koreans appeared, demanding they stop cutting the branches. When Capt Bonifas ignored them, the North Koreans attacked - using clubs and axes wrenched from the gardening party to bludgeon the captain and US Lieutenant Mark Barrett to death. The North Koreans longing for homeA Noth Korean\\'s daring escape from sexcam captivitySirens went off throughout the DMZ and troops were put on high alert. Word of the attack quickly reached Washington DC, where Secretary of State Henry Kissinger called for an attack on the North Korean barracks to ensure \"a high probability of getting the people who did this\". \"They have killed two Americans and if we do nothing, they will do it again,\" he told a briefing. \"We have to do something.\"In the end, Kissinger was overruled. While military and political leaders debated how best to respond, they all agreed on one thing: the tree had to go. Commanders came up with a plan to prune the tree back using a massive show of force. It was designated Operation Paul Bunyan - named after a giant lumberjack in US folklore - and scheduled for 21 August.

He drove his commanding officer to a briefing the night before the tree-cutting operation, and saw a lieutenant ask what would happen to his unit. \"I watched the officer turn around with this piece of chalk and draw an X through our unit designation on the chalk board, then turn back around and say, \\'Any more questions?\\'\" Mr Johnson says.The teenager was tasked with rigging Camp Liberty Bell with explosives that night to destroy the base in case the North Koreans attacked and tried to capture it. Then he drove up to meet the rest of his unit at the JSA, passing through US and South Korean checkpoints as he went. \"I thought that was kind of funny,\" he says. \"At the DMZ gates I had to go through a checkpoint there. I\\'m thinking, what the hell, don\\'t these guys know that things are going to happen?\"\\'We were prepared not to come back\\'Bill Ferguson and Mike Bilbo spent the night preparing for their own mission - driving in and securing what is known as the Bridge of No Return to prevent North Korean forces driving into the JSA and interfering with the tree cutting.

And when we pulled out from our camp, there\\'s Cobra helicopters hovering just off the ground getting ready to take off. \"I looked down the road and here is all these as far as I can see truckloads of soldiers. It\\'s an invasion force of some kind.\"Ted Schaner was a 27-year-old captain with the 2nd Battalion 9th Infantry, and one of the men in the helicopters hovering overhead as the soldiers drove in towards the tree.

They, too, were unsure whether war was about to break out. \"We were, of course, hoping it wouldn\\'t, but I felt... we were prepared if that\\'s what was going to happen. I was proud of my soldiers.\"Alpha company of the 2nd Battalion 9th Infantry - Wayne Johnson\\'s company - remained on the ground. \"We were prepared not to come back,\" says Joel Brown, then a 19-year-old private with Alpha Company. \"It felt kind of surreal... We\\'ve been here since 1950 and it\\'s all going to go down over this tree.\"Image source, Wayne JohnsonImage caption, US troops moved into the JSA early in the morning to cover the engineers coming in to cut back the treeBill Ferguson and Mike Bilbo\\'s platoon arrived just as the fog was lifting. Their truck driver reversed onto the Bridge of No Return to block the crossing, while the men jumped out armed only with pistols and axe handles. \"Almost immediately a dump truck comes up, and it\\'s got engineers in it,\" says Mr Bilbo. \"I\\'ve never seen chainsaws so long.\"Charles Twardzicki of the 2nd Engineer Battalion had spent the night practising to use the tools. The 25-year-old sergeant had suggested bringing in heavier equipment to take the tree down, but officers feared it would be too difficult to speedily get them out if the North Koreans tried to intervene - leaving them to cut back the branches by hand. \"We have to use a ladder to get up into the tree,\" he says. \"We got one guy on the headache board [behind the truck\\'s cab] cutting one, and I\\'m cutting another. His chainsaw is about where my head is.\"As the engineers chopped, the troops watched North Korean forces arrive in trucks and buses. \"We can see the North Koreans across from us setting up machine guns,\" says Mike Bilbo. \"I\\'m looking around where I\\'m going to go when the artillery comes in. In fact, all the artillery - ours and theirs - was zeroed in on us.\"Image source, Bill FergusonImage caption, US engineers pruned the tree with chainsaws, leaving only the trunkSeveral US soldiers remember they and the South Korean special forces who accompanied them had sneaked heavy weapons into the area under sandbags on the floor of their trucks. Some South Koreans even strapped claymore mines to their chests and held the detonators in their hands, goading the North Koreans to attack.\"I understood some of the bad words in Korean and it was a lot of bad words, let me tell you,\" says Wayne Johnson, who was standing just yards away from Bill Ferguson and Mike Bilbo during the tree cutting. But the North Koreans did not intervene. Once the branches were cut down, the US and South Korean forces quickly withdrew from the JSA - although other forces in the DMZ remained on alert. The entire operation was over in less than 45 minutes. \\'A pretty poor trade\\'\"Everybody was jazzed up,\" Mike Bilbo says. \"Symbolic things bother the North Koreans more than the actual.\"\"One day I went out and sawed a couple pieces of the branch... Everybody\\'s got a piece of that damned tree,\" he says.Image source, AFP/GettyImage caption, Since 2018, North and South Korea have demilitarised the JSA, removing all mines and guard postsSoldiers felt they had made the North Koreans lose face, something they knew would enrage them. But others remained angry.\"I felt that we got the worst part of it,\" says Charles Twardzicki. \"We were just trimming the tree and you killed a couple of our officers - so we cut it down... I thought it was a pretty poor trade.\"\"We didn\\'t want to be the ones responsible for starting a whole new war, but we were also dying for the chance to extract some blood,\" says Bill Ferguson. Rules in the JSA changed shortly after Operation Paul Bunyan. North Koreans were separated from UN forces with the small concrete barrier that President Donald Trump stepped over in July - putting an end to the mingling and intimidation tactics.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, President Trump: \"Stepping across that line was a great honour\"\"That was a major letdown,\" Bill Ferguson says. \"North Korea was never that fond with that arrangement, it being a neutral area... To me and several others enforcing the line through the JSA, it was basically a capitulation.\"However, a rare expression of regret from then-North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung about the deaths of the US soldiers on the day of the tree cutting made many realise they had sufficiently shocked the country with the vast display of US firepower. Troops at Camp Liberty Bell and the JSA stayed on high alert after the operation, in case of retaliation.

Defectors based in South Korea have told us that their families in the North are going hungry. There is a concern as winter approaches that the most vulnerable will starve.\"Problems such as more orphan children on the streets and death by starvation are continuously being reported,\" said Lee Sang Yong, editor in chief of the Daily NK, which has sources in North Korea.\"The lower classes in North Korea are suffering more and more,\" as food shortages are worse than expected, Mr Lee said.Getting information out of North Korea is increasingly difficult. The border has been closed since January last year to prevent the spread of Covid-19 from China. Even getting messages out of the country to family and friends who have defected to South Korea comes at a huge risk. Anyone caught with an unauthorised mobile phone could be thrown into a labour camp. And yet some still try to send letters or voice mail via text to their loved ones and to publications in Seoul. Through these sources, some of which have to remain anonymous, we have tried to build a picture of what is going on.\\'Every grain of rice\\'North Korea has always struggled with food shortages, but the pandemic has made a bad situation worse. Leader Kim Jong-un has compared the current situation to the country\\'s worst disaster in the 1990\\'s, known as the \"Arduous March\", where hundreds of thousands of people died in a famine.The situation is not thought to be that bad - yet. There are some hopeful signs. North Korea appears to be preparing to re-open the border with China, but it\\'s unclear how much trade and aid will be needed to repair the economic damage already wrought on the impoverished country.This year\\'s harvest is crucial. Last year\\'s crops were partly destroyed by a series of typhoons. The United Nations estimates that the country is short of at least two to three months\\' supply of food.To ensure this year is as successful as possible, tens of thousands of people have been sent into the fields to help gather rice and corn, including the army. Kim Jong-un has also reportedly ordered that every grain of rice in the country is to be secured and that everyone who eats should go and help with the harvest.\"A plan has been devised to minimise losses in the harvesting process,\" said Mr Lee, from the Daily NK. \"It emphasises that strict punishment will be imposed if theft or cheating is reported. It\\'s creating an atmosphere of fear.\"Image caption, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un seems willing to openly acknowledge the severity of the situationLast week, South Korea\\'s National Intelligence Service (NIS) told a closed-door parliamentary hearing that Mr Kim said he felt he was \"walking on thin ice due to the economic situation\", according to lawmakers at the briefing. The NIS also reportedly said the lack of medicine and essential supplies has accelerated the spread of infectious diseases such as typhoid fever.This growing concern has been amplified by state media, which has highlighted measures being taken to prevent crop damage and released propaganda posters emphasising efforts to work on food production.Modern farmingNorth Korea is facing two major issues with its food supply. The first is its farming methods. Pyongyang may have invested in new military technology and missiles, but it lacks the modern machinery needed for a speedy and successful harvest, according to experts.Choi Yongho from the Korean Rural Economic Institute told us that \"the insufficient supply of agricultural equipment results in low food productivity\".We managed to see this for ourselves.From a new lookout point in the western tip of South Korea, with the affluent skyscrapers of Seoul as a backdrop, my team and I got a good view over the Han River into North Korea. It feels so close - and yet so far.Image caption, From a new lookout point in the western tip of South Korea people can get a good view into the NorthI heard one young girl remark through her binoculars that they were the \"same people\". \"They\\'re just like us\", she said, as she bounced back to her mum.The villagers, dozens of them, were busy creating bails of rice and carrying them on their backs to a rather run-down tractor. A South Korean farmer in Paju, near the demilitarised zone which separates the two countries, said it took him an hour to strip his fields of rice with a machine. If he\\'d done it by hand, as it\\'s done in the North, he said one field would take him a week.Image caption, A South Korean farmer strips his fields of rice with a machineHighly vulnerableBut along with the lack of technology and farming supplies, North Korea is facing a much longer-term problem if it wants to secure its food supply.The country has been listed by US intelligence agencies as one of 11 countries most vulnerable to the effects of global warming, and the limited area it has to grow crops could be the hardest hit.\"Rice and maize yield failures will become more likely along the Western coastline, which is North Korea\\'s historical breadbasket,\" said Catherine Dill, from the Council on Strategic Risks - one of the authors of a recent report on \\'Converging Crises in North Korea\\'. That may explain why Pyongyang sent its UK ambassador to the 26th UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow.\"North Korea is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters. Flood, monsoon rains and typhoons trouble them every year which directly affect yield and indirectly cause pest problems,\" said Mr Choi.Image caption, North Korea is particularly vulnerable to natural disastersThe \\'Converging Crises\\' report suggests this will get much worse in years to come and rice production in particular will be affected by droughts and flooding.\"More intense storms already appear to be affecting North Korea, there are really prominent examples of this in both the 2020 and 2021 typhoon seasons. And in terms of sea level rise, coastal areas are going to be increasingly at risk,\" Ms Dill said.While Pyongyang rarely engages with the outside world, it has often made an exception for climate change and the environment.North Korea worked with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on detailed country reports in 2003 and 2012, and is also a signatory to international treaties including the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.One reason for this engagement on climate change may be its impact on food production. The 2012 UNEP report noted that the average temperature in North Korea increased by 1.9Â°C between 1918 and 2000, among Asia\\'s fastest warming rates.According to a 2019 Green Climate Fund report, annual average temperatures in North Korea are further expected to rise by 2.8-4.7Â°C by the 2050\\'s.South Korea sees a chance here to work together on a problem that affects them both.Seoul\\'s Environment Minister Han Jeoung-ae told me last week that she hoped to meet her counterpart in Glasgow to talk about inter-Korean collaboration on climate change but that hasn\\'t happened. If the North Korean delegation is listening to the speeches in Scotland they will know that even when the fear of this pandemic eases and trade with China resumes, even when goods once again start to flow over the border, the country faces a growing crisis which will profoundly affect an already vulnerable population. And it cannot overcome this on its own.You might also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, North Korean potato propaganda is making a comeback... but what does it mean?Additional reporting by Shreyas Reddy of BBC Monitoring.Related TopicsKim Jong-unNorth KoreaMore on this storyVulnerable North Koreans at risk of starvation - UN13 October 2021Why doesn\\'t North Korea have enough food?23 June 2021Kim Jong-un admits North Korea food concerns17 June 2021Top StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

The BBC was given rare access to the countries\\' joint control centre. But what is the purpose of these war games and could they backfire? Deep in a military bunker outside Seoul, two air force colonels sit shoulder-to-shoulder. One is American, the other South Korean. Together, their eyes scour satellite pictures of North Korea, played out on giant screens at the front of the dark room. The images are one of many sources of intelligence fed into the classified vault. \"We have the ability to detect the instant a North Korean missile gets off the ground,\" explains Col Anthony Kuczynski, who runs the operation centre for the US side. After that, an algorithm predicts where that missile might be heading. \"Then, with my terrible Korean, and his excellent English, we can reach a decision quickly,\" he adds, pointing to his South Korean counterpart, Col Soe.This operations centre on the US Osan airbase is unique as the only place in the world where two militaries work in harmony to defend one country. This is the commitment the United States gave South Korea after the Korean War ended almost 70 years ago without a peace treaty. The countries\\' air forces, armies, navies, space and cyber operations are coordinated in this one room - its current importance highlighted when Joe Biden became the first US president to visit in May. This week, for the first time in four years, the two militaries will run field exercises, to practise how they would respond to a North Korean attack. Such exercises, though once routine, were cancelled in 2018 as the US and South Korea tried to convince the North to get rid of its nuclear weapons. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Col Kuczynski (R) with President Biden on his visit to the centre in MayBut after years of diplomatic stalemate, and faced with an increasingly hostile North Korea, both countries have decided it\\'s time to resume training.North Korea has fired more missiles this year than in any other single year, and its weapons are becoming increasingly sophisticated. They appear more able to evade defences and hit their targets. Meanwhile, intelligence suggests it\\'s on the cusp of conducting its seventh nuclear test, which it may use to perfect a smaller, battlefield nuclear weapon that could be used in a conflict against South Korea. Add to this a slew of recent warnings from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that he is prepared to use his nukes against the South.All considered, Seoul seems ever more at risk, and defending the South Korean capital is one of the scenarios the forces are practising. The nine-day exercises, named Ulchi Freedom Shield, will draw in aircraft, warships and tanks. They will wargame not only how to repel a North Korean attack, but also how to strike back at the enemy.\"I can\\'t teach this in a classroom, it is an art,\" says Colonel Kuczynski. \"I have to run people through it, creating the most intense environment I can. The Korean Peninsula is not very big, so the time we have to act is very limited.\"But there is concern that these exercises will provoke North Korea, which views them as a rehearsal for an invasion. The mere news that they were restarting led Mr Kim to accuse the US and South Korea of bringing the Peninsula to the \"brink of war\". It is feared Pyongyang could retaliate by testing more missiles, conducting its much-anticipated nuclear test or even initiating a small-scale skirmish.South Korea\\'s defence vice-minister Shin Beomchul told the BBC it\\'s unfair to accuse them of antagonising North Korea and the drills should not be blamed for any future military action by the North. \"They know these drills are defensive, they just use them as an excuse,\" he said. \"They will carry out provocations for their own military and political aims, so we cannot listen to their criticism.\"Image source, News 1Image caption, The BBC was given rare access to the Korean Air Operation CentreAt the airbase, above ground, a US fighter pilot, Capt Abbey Wolters, was preparing for training. She explained how flying with South Koreans makes her more efficient: \"The communication is much smoother in the air if we\\'ve practised together, so we can go quicker and be more deadly in our job.\"But some question whether South Korea, even with US help, would be able defend itself if the North fired a nuclear weapon. A report earlier this year concluded that a missile attack by Pyongyang would have a high probability of success, despite the current defences in place. The head of Airforce at Osan airbase, Lt Gen Scott Pleus, strongly refuted this. When asked about the progress North Koreans are making, he responded confidently: \"And so are we.\"These drills are as much about showcasing strength - to try to stop North Korea from ever using its weapons. Seoul has warned that if Pyongyang were to test a nuke, it would unleash a \"high-intensity\" response. US bombers and other weapons would be sent to South Korea, Vice-Minister Shin confirmed, and Seoul, along with Washington, would impose further sanctions. \"There is never a 100% guarantee with missile defences, but we can thwart their ambition to attack us,\" he said.Image source, KCNAImage caption, Kim Jong Un accused the US and South Korea of bringing the Peninsula to the \"brink of war\"South Korea doesn\\'t have nuclear weapons of its own. It is protected by what is known as a nuclear umbrella: an agreement that the United States would use its nuclear weapons to defend Seoul if necessary. It\\'s hoped this is enough to prevent North Korea from ever launching an attack, but it\\'s a concept South Koreans are increasingly uncomfortable with. A poll this year showed 71% of people supported the country developing its own nuclear weapons, even though the president here says there are no plans to do so. As the thinking goes, if North Korea has nuclear weapons capable of reaching the US mainland, could it not threaten the United States and convince it to stay out of a conflict with South Korea - just as Vladimir Putin hinted he would use nuclear weapons in Ukraine? Would the US really forfeit San Francisco for Seoul? Lt Gen Pleus sought to assuage those fears. \"That you have 28,500 US service men and women stationed on this peninsula every single day, should give people the unbelievably comfortable feeling that we are here to stay and we are here to protect them.\"These drills, meant to deter North Korea, could well end up provoking it, or at least provide the smokescreen for it to test and improve its weaponry. But faced with an increasingly formidable foe, the United States and South Korea believe they have little choice but to prepare.

It is also being found in mammals.What is bird flu and how deadly is it?Bird flu is an infectious disease of poultry and wild birds that has been around for a century. It usually flares up in autumn before fading away in spring and summer. \"It originated amongst ducks in Europe and Asia, and spread to other birds,\" says Paul Digard, a professor of virology in the Roslin Institute at Edinburgh University. The H5N1 virus, which is the most prevalent strain now, was first reported in China in 1996. It can spread through entire flocks of domestic birds within a matter of days, through birds\\' droppings and saliva, or through contaminated feed and water. Image source, Getty ImagesThe World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) has recorded almost 42 million individual cases in domestic and wild birds since the outbreak began in October 2021.Almost 15 million domestic birds, including poultry, have died from the disease, and more than 193 million more have been culled.In some European countries it has led to egg shortages in shops.What\\'s so unusual about this outbreak?More wild birds than ever before have been killed by this outbreak - with sea birds being especially hard hit.The current virus has affected 80 different bird species,\" says Professor Munir Iqbal, the head of the Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) group at the Pirbright Institute. More than 40% of the skua population in Scotland, and thousands of Dalmatian pelicans in Greece have died. Scientists are unsure why this outbreak is so much worse than others. It may be that the virus has mutated to enable it to spread more readily from bird to bird, or to hang around longer in the environment.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The recent spike in bird flu has been particularly harmful to protected seabird species like the gannetDr Nancy Beerens, bird flu expert at Wageningen Bioveterinary Research in the Netherlands, which analyses suspected bird flu samples, says the virus may now be ubiquitous in wild birds. \"As the virus now has infected many wild bird species, it becomes unlikely that it will disappear again from the bird population,\" she says. What\\'s being done to tackle the outbreak?China has been vaccinating its domestic poultry flocks. However, other countries avoid this because it is hard to judge which birds have been made immune and which have not - and so the meat and eggs from vaccinated flocks cannot be sold abroad.\"There are strict export controls when a country decides to vaccinate,\" says Dr Maurice Pitesky of the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis. Governments in EU countries and North America have instead generally told their farmers to cull all the poultry in any flock in which bird flu has broken out.Farmers in the UK and France have also been told to bring free range poultry flocks indoors, to stop them being infected by wild birds. Despite the commercial drawbacks of vaccinating poultry, governments in France and the Netherlands have begun trials of vaccines to try and bring the bird flu epidemic under control.How is bird flu passing to mammals?WOAH has counted 119 outbreaks of the virus amongst mammals, although it says this is undoubtedly an underestimate. Species affected include dolphins and seals, foxes and otters in the UK, grizzly bears in the US and mink in Spain. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Otters are amongst the mammals which have caught bird fluIt is believed the infected mammals had fed on dead or sick wild birds which had the virus.There has been no evidence yet of the virus spreading between mammals.The virus may also have mutated to infect the mammals more easily.Bird flu \\'spills over\\' to otters and foxes in UKIs bird flu a risk to humans?The World Health Organization (WHO) says 870 humans have been infected with avian flu over the past 20 years, and 457 have died. These cases occurred when humans came into close contact with infected birds.The World Health Organization says the further spread of the H5N1 virus will have to be monitored closely to see whether it is mutating into a form which can spread amongst humans.Follow Helen on Twitter @hbriggs.Related TopicsBirdsTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

He denies ever having non-consensual sex with anyone.Deputy District Attorney Paul Thomson told the court on Monday that eight women allegedly attacked by Weinstein would testify.He quoted Weinstein\\'s accusers, saying one had recalled of the alleged assault: \"Part of me was thinking I should just make a run for it, but he\\'s a big guy.\" Another alleged victim had said: \"I was scared that if I didn\\'t play nice something could happen in the room or out of the room because of his power in the industry,\" the prosecutor told the court. Weinstein - who was wheeled into court wearing a black suit, blue tie and glasses - listened impassively to the prosecutor.Mark Werskman, for the defence, told the court the accusers were lying. He said two accusers had fabricated their alleged encounters with the former producer, and that the other two Jane Does had \"transactional sex\" with him. He suggested Jane Doe Four, an anonymous name for one of the accusers, was \"just another bimbo who slept with Harvey Weinstein to get ahead in Hollywood\".The Los Angeles trial is causing many in Hollywood to look back at the #MeToo movement and assess its success. A recent study by the advocacy group WIF (Women in Film, Los Angeles) showed that while 83% of respondents felt that progress has been made since 2017, a staggering 69% said they had personally experienced abuse or misconduct at work since the movement began. How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfoldedHarvey Weinstein trial begins in Los AngelesCritics mostly positive about MeToo film She Said \"It\\'s lost momentum,\" WIF CEO Kirsten Schaffer said of the movement for equal rights and representation for women. Seasoned film producers often ask their stars to shoot sex scenes on the first day of filming. That way, an actor can\\'t change their mind about nudity halfway through a film when recasting would prove expensive. That still happens in Hollywood, five years after stories of systemic sexual assault and harassment rocked Hollywood and ignited the #MeToo.But now, it\\'s likely an intimacy co-ordinator will be on set making sure actors feel comfortable and safe as they simulate sex. Schaffer continues: \"I think there is forward motion. And that\\'s why it\\'s not super depressing,\" she says, adding that five years ago the response to #MeToo was intense, with \"so many people caring about it, putting new policies in place, launching programmes\".And many people in Hollywood say those policies are working. Actresses say they\\'re offered more interesting roles, and there are more opportunities for female crew members, writers and directors. Rosanna Arquette, one of Weinstein\\'s first public accusers, was part of the Screen Actors Guild committee which helped introduce intimacy co-ordinators on set, to make sure everyone is comfortable in any scene requiring nudity. \"A lot of people were against the intimacy co-ordinators, but you know, a lot of abuse did happen that way,\" Ms Arquette told the BBC. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Rose McGowan and Rosanna Arquette came forward with accounts of abuse by Weinstein in 2017Many aspiring actors say the industry has changed for the better. When we visited an acting class five years ago, many told us horror stories of the fear they face going into auditions - the very real fear that they might be sexually assaulted or propositioned in exchange for a role.At the Michelle Danner Acting Studio this week, aspiring stars spoke to the BBC about their experiences auditioning and performing in low-budget films hoping to get their big break. Aside from a few sleazy propositions, most said they\\'d been treated with respect.Ms Danner, who runs the acting studio and directs movies, says the casting couch will never fully disappear but that people are much more careful now. Auditions have become much more safe and formal experiences, with monitors and rules about the number of people in a room. And due to the pandemic, many are now taking them via video phone.\"The fears are real,\" says Ms Danner, adding that people feel empowered to speak up now more than ever if there is misconduct at work. \"The #MeToo movement created that, and there\\'s no going back. I don\\'t think you can ever close the door to what has started.\" Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Weinstein was known for producing films such as Shakespeare in Love and Pulp FictionThe Academy of Motion Pictures has responded to criticism of Hollywood by significantly diversifying its membership, inviting more women and people of colour to be part of the group which hosts the Oscars. But it can only do so much and the statistics for women in film can be fairly grim. According to the Center for the Study of Women in Film in Television, female characters accounted for just 35% of major characters in the top 100 grossing films in 2021, down three percentage points from the previous year. And after reaching historic highs in 2020, the percentages of women directing top grossing films declined in 2021. The number of women working as directors on the top 100 films retreated from 16% in 2020 to 12% in 2021.But more women are producing film and TV - 32% of producers (up from 30% in 2020).Many powerful female players like Reese Witherspoon have started their own production companies, to make the kind of films and TV shows they want to see. That urge has spread throughout the industry. At the Danner acting school, actresses Josephine Hies and Meitar Paz have started producing as well as acting so they can have more control over the stories they tell. As a producer you have \"a different power in how you tell stories\" and power over which stories are told, Hies said. Image source, Universal PicturesImage caption, Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan star in She Said, a new film about journalists investigating WeinsteinHarvey Weinstein\\'s downfall is now immortalised in a film. She Said stars Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan as the New York Times reporters who investigated the sexual harassment and abuse claims against Weinstein. It\\'s due to hit cinemas in the US in November, and Weinstein\\'s lawyers failed in their attempt to delay its release, claiming it would prejudice the jury that\\'s just been selected against him. At the film\\'s New York premiere, the stars rubbed shoulders with many of Weinstein\\'s accusers, some of whom have roles in the film. Rowena Chiu, Weinstein\\'s former assistant who says he sexually assaulted her then coerced her into signing a Non-Disclosure Agreement, or NDA, says she hopes the film will inspire healthier workplaces. She came forward 20 years after the alleged assault to tell her story, because she thought it was important to say that it wasn\\'t just Hollywood actors who were targeted. \"It\\'s important that we uphold the legal system. There were dozens of women he assaulted and only a handful can testify,\" she said. \"I\\'m not involved in Hollywood. I don\\'t work in Hollywood,\" she said. \"It\\'s important to show our stories.\"Related TopicsFilmHarvey Weinstein trialHarvey Weinstein#MeToo campaignMore on this storyHarvey Weinstein trial begins in Los Angeles10 October 2022How the Harvey Weinstein scandal has unfolded7 hours agoCritics mostly positive about MeToo film She Said14 October 2022Top StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

Authorities can\\'t say what it is yet - not even the police or bomb squad sent to investigate. But what is known is that it\\'s hollow - and not a threat. Many suspect it to be a type of buoy. The find in coastal city Hamamatsu has been variously dubbed \"Godzilla egg\", \"mooring buoy\" and \"from outer space\" by fascinated locals.Japanese broadcaster NHK showed footage of two officials on Enshuhama Beach looking at the rusty, metal sphere that appeared about 1.5m (4.9ft) wide.It had been found by a local who alerted police after noticing the unusual object on the shore.Authorities cordoned off the area and conducted X-ray exams which did not reveal much more - other than confirming the object was safe.A runner on the beach told local media he was surprised by the commotion, as the ball had been there for some time. \"I tried to push it but it wouldn\\'t budge,\" NHK reported him saying.Local authorities have said the object will be removed soon.This kind of find might not normally raise suspicion - but it comes amid general nervousness over unidentified objects since the US shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon earlier this month.Japan separately expressed concern to China on Wednesday about suspected surveillance balloons spotted over its skies at least three times since 2019 - an allegation it first made last week. Beijing denies claims of espionage.The two countries\\' defence ministers met on Wednesday, in the first senior bilateral security dialogue in four years. Both sides agreed to work toward launching a communications hotline this spring.

Here, 10 Ukrainians share the last photo they took on their mobile phones before their country changed forever - and talk about what has happened to them since.Selfies and walksImage source, Angelina ChabanThis was taken on 23 February 2022 and captures my walk around my district. It was good weather that day, but there was a feeling that something might happen.I took the picture because of the nice weather and because I was looking good. It\\'s in the countryside on the outskirts of Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine. It\\'s my favourite place.In the first weeks after Russia\\'s invasion I stayed at home, but on 7 April, we moved west to Vinnytsia and then to Kyiv.When I look at the picture, it feels like it is from a different life.Angelina Chaban, 24Working from home with my catImage source, AnnaI was working at home on 22 February, taking calls with my cat next to me, just enjoying life. I took the picture because my cat looked adorable.Her name is Fura, which means truck. My sister rescued her from the side of a highway when she was a kitten.There was some media coverage at the time suggesting something was going to happen, and people were talking about it. But I was hopeful that if there was an escalation, it wouldn\\'t affect the civilian population. On the 25th we decided to leave Kyiv. We brought the cat with us and moved to north-west Ukraine. In the summer, we returned. Anna, 32Pre-school projectsImage source, Ihor BezrukyiMy daughter, Marta, made this candle in pre-school and brought it home on 22 February. I remember being happy that the children were being creative and making things, and I was proud of her because it was so pretty and well made.I didn\\'t know then what would happen next.My daughter will turn seven in March but she hasn\\'t been to pre-school since 24 February last year. My wife won\\'t let her.Initially, I was really worried that if there was a war my family and I would have to separate. But we\\'re still here.Ihor Bezrukyi, 51Dinner and drinks with friendsImage source, Valeriia DubrovskaIt was just an ordinary day and after work I decided to pop into my friend\\'s bar to have a couple of drinks. Afterwards, they took me out for some beer, local food and vodka made from horseradish root.I don\\'t remember exactly what I was feeling but I know we were cracking jokes. We did talk about the possibility of a Russian invasion, but then all together we were like: \"Nah\". A couple of days after the invasion, I met two of the guys I was out with that evening. We were all helping the military to build barricades around the centre of Odesa. Looking back, it was a spectacular sight - dozens of hipsters lugging sandbags.When I look at the photo now, I feel nostalgic for the person I used to be.Valeriia Dubrovska, 28A long weekend in LvivImage source, Sofiia DoroshenkoA friend had come to visit me in Lviv on her birthday and it was the first long weekend off I\\'d had in a while.We did a tour of the city and went to see a newly-opened panoramic view from the Church of Sts Olha and Elizabeth. We were the last visitors there that day, so they asked us to close the door as we left.I felt pure happiness in those days. I was happy with my friends and my work. But there was also something in the air, a sense that something inevitable was coming and that everything would change.Nowadays, the viewing point we looked out of is closed. I am still in Lviv, but I rarely take photos with my phone. Now I take camera photos to document what is happening.Sofiia Doroshenko, 30Family days at homeImage source, Ievgen PereverzievI took this photo of my first child, Yaroslav, on 19 February at our home in Dnipro. He was only six months old at the time. My dog is also in it - she\\'s a big friend of my son.We left our home on 24 February. I drove for three days to the western part of Ukraine to bring my family to a safer place. Our home in Dnipro is still there but no-one is living in it. I had to ask friends to clean it because when we left the fridge was still full of food.I used to own a travel agency but now tourism is completely dead. Now, I volunteer with the army, bringing cars for the military from the border to the central part of Ukraine. I\\'m always driving, driving, driving.In this period of a child\\'s life they grow so quickly. Sometimes I\\'m away for 10 days and when I come back I find he has learned something new.Ievgen Pereverziev, 40A semi-final matchImage source, Borys ShelahurovWe posed for a team photo after losing in the semi-finals of a local football tournament in Kharkiv. I scored the only goal in that game for our team.Even though we lost, we were happy because we had played well. I didn\\'t believe at the time that a war would happen.I want to play another tournament with my team.Borys Shelahurov, 28A driving lesson and a coffee cupImage source, Oleksandr PopenkoI took this picture of a \"Paris I love you\" coffee cup on 22 February 2022 after a driving lesson. It was part of a photo project I\\'ve been working on. We were living in Bucha and spent the first two weeks after the invasion in the basement of a pre-school that was close to our building. I lost 10kg in those two weeks.We escaped Russian occupation by foot on 10 March, walking 22km (14 miles). When we reached the first Ukrainian checkpoint, I nearly cried.I\\'m still trying to do my photo project despite the war. I still haven\\'t passed my driving test.Oleksandr Popenko, 29Fooling around with friendsImage source, Andrii RybkaI work at the Lviv National Art Gallery, the Potocki Palace. Every year, the museum puts up these cheesy winter decorations until the spring and I always make fun of them.Everyone in the city was talking about the possibility of war. A couple of days before the 24th, not knowing what might happen of course, I asked my friend to take a picture of me with the decorations - to take the edge off.I\\'m still working at the museum but everything is different now. It feels like 100 years have passed, we have lived through so much.Andrii Rybka, 43Children\\'s games at the galleryImage source, Zhenya MolyarThis picture was taken at the presentation of a new book in the National Art Museum in Kyiv. While the adults were talking, my children and my friend\\'s children sat down to play a game.On 6 March, I drove with my children to the Hungarian border, left the car there and continued on foot.I think about how carefree the children are in this photo and how, so soon afterwards, they were forced to make such a disturbing journey - driving for a long time without knowing where they were going, as their mothers cried.Zhenya Molyar, 41Stories edited for length and clarity.

I wanted to raise money for the Ukrainians who are still there either defending their homeland, in hiding from the shelling by the invaders, or helping other Ukrainians fleeing their homes in different parts of the country.\"He said he had started doing long walks for charities in 2013 and had done one a year since then.\\'So inspiring\\'Mr Kowal, 40, a second-generation Ukrainian who works as a support analyst at Next\\'s head office, near Leicester, plans to leave Nottingham via Ruddington and chart a course through Charnwood before reaching Leicester.\"I expect it will take between nine and 10 hours,\" he said. \"I\\'m really going to push myself to the limit because I want to be at the vigil and show my support.\"He said he had relatives in Ukraine, including a cousin on the front line.\"I just want to raise as much as I can for the people in Ukraine because I find their determination so inspiring,\" he said.He plans to raise funds for the charity British-Ukrainian Aid.\"They do great work in supplying medical supplies and equipment to the front line,\" he said.A spokesperson for the Leicester Ukrainian Centre said it had helped to send more than 17,000 boxes of aid to Ukraine since March 2022.She said members would be gathering at Town Hall Square to hold a candlelight vigil of remembrance.\"We will be commemorating and condemning the atrocity against the peaceful country of Ukraine, honouring the fallen soldiers and civilian victims, and supporting the armed forces of Ukraine,\" she added.Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

Three of the five charges against Mr Weinstein relate to Ms Mann.13 February 2020In her closing arguments, Weinstein\\'s lead attorney Donna Rotunno urges the 12 jurors to make themselves \"unpopular\" by acquitting him, insisting he had been innocent from the start.The prosecution\\'s case rests on whether the jury believes the accusations of six women, although the jury is considering charges related to just two: ex-actress Jessica Mann and former production assistant Mimi Haleyi, as other claims are too old to prosecute.18 February 2020With all the evidence heard, the jury begins deliberations. Judge James Burke reminds them that to convict, they must be sure of the defendant\\'s guilt beyond all reasonable doubt and must reach unanimous verdicts on each count. If they cannot, the judge may be forced to declare a mistrial.Judge Burke warns lead defence lawyer Donna Rotunno not to talk to the press after an opinion piece she wrote for Newsweek drew the ire of prosecutors.24 February 2020After five days of deliberation, the jury finds Weinstein guilty of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and third-degree rape.The 67-year-old is convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping ex-actress Jessica Mann in 2013.He is acquitted of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault, charges that could have seen him jailed for life.Though cleared of the most serious charges made against him, the producer still faces up to 25 years in prison on the sexual assault conviction.11 March 2020Weinstein is sentenced to 23 years in prison for rape and sexual assault.The 67-year-old appeared in court on Wednesday in a wheelchair.His lawyers had appealed for leniency, saying even the minimum sentence of five years could be a \"life sentence\" but prosecutors argued Weinstein should be given the maximum possible sentence, given his \"lifetime of abuse\" towards women and \"lack of remorse\" for his actions.29 May 2020Weinstein is accused of sexual assault by four further women as he serves a 23-year prison sentence.Court documents filed in New York on Thursday allege several sexual offences dating from 1984 to 2013.One of the four anonymous women was 17 at the time of an alleged attack.Weinstein\\'s legal representative told BBC News: \"Mr Weinstein intends to defend against the claims filed anonymously against him yesterday.\"5 April 2021Weinstein\\'s lawyers launch an appeal against his conviction, arguing the judge made errors that denied his right to a fair trial.In a 166-page brief they raise seven examples of alleged errors and say the judge disregarded \"fundamental principles of New York law and violated Mr Weinstein\\'s constitutional rights\".15 June 2021A New York judge ruled Weinstein can be extradited to California to face additional sexual assault charges.Weinstein\\'s defence team had argued that he should remain in New York to receive appropriate medical care.21 July 2021Weinstein pleaded not guilty to rape and sexual assault charges in a Los Angeles court.He appeared in court in a wheelchair after being extradited from New York, where he is serving a 23-year jail sentence for similar crimes.2 June 2022A New York appellate court upheld Weinstein\\'s rape conviction, rejecting his claims that the judge had prejudiced him by allowing women to testify about allegations that were not part of the criminal case.8 June 2022The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) authorised the Metropolitan Police to charge Weinstein with two counts of indecent assault against a woman in London in the summer of 1996.It came after a review of evidence gathered by the force. It is alleged two offences took place in London between 31 July and 31 August 1996.25 October 2022Weinstein goes on trial in LA, facing 11 charges involving five alleged victims.20 December 2022Weinstein is found guilty by a Los Angeles jury of raping a woman.The two-month trial heard how Weinstein used his influence to lure women into private meetings before attacking them.The 70-year-old Oscar winner faces up to 24 years in prison when he is sentenced.23 February 2023Weinstein is sentenced to 16 years in prison for the 2013 rape of an actress in Los Angeles.He begged for leniency in a Los Angeles court moments before he was sentenced, saying he did not \"deserve\" life in prison.The anonymous victim told the court before the sentencing about the trauma she had endured for \"many years\" since the assault.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

During this time of year, a significant proportion of what the UK consumes usually comes from those regions.The shortages are expected to last \"a few weeks\" until the UK growing season begins and retailers find alternative sources of supply, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. Andrew Opie, director of Food and Sustainability at the trade group, added that supermarkets are \"adept at managing supply chain issues\" and were working with farmers to ensure the continued supply of fresh produce.Rising costs hit chip shops and potato farmsFour ways climate change is affecting weatherEgg farmers squeezed as costs riseAs well as tomatoes, peppers and lettuce, Asda said it was also limiting sales of salad bags, cucumbers, broccoli, cauliflowers and raspberry punnets.\"Like other supermarkets, we are experiencing sourcing challenges on some products that are grown in southern Spain and north Africa,\" a spokesperson said.Morrisons said as well that cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce and peppers were affected at its shops.In the winter months the UK imports around 95% of its tomatoes and 90% of its lettuces, most of it from Spain and north Africa, according to the BRC.Southern Spain has been suffering unusually cold weather and in Morocco crop yields have been affected by floods, while storms have led to ferries being delayed or cancelled.Meanwhile in the UK and Netherlands, farmers have cut back on their use of greenhouses to grow winter crops due to higher electricity prices.UK crops hitPaul Smith, from wholesaler Oliver Kay, said with lower levels of planting this year, there was less surplus available to offset reduced yields elsewhere.\"Growers across the UK and Europe have been battling with severe weather conditions for a number of months now,\" he said.A spell of heatwaves in June 2022 led to the fourth warmest UK summer on record and temperatures broke the 40C mark for the first time. That was followed by sharp, prolonged freezes in December.Tim O\\'Malley, managing director of Nationwide Produce, one of the UK\\'s largest fresh produce firms, has warned his customers that could mean \"major shortages\" in domestically grown crops too. UK crops of carrots, parsnips, cabbage and cauliflower had been affected by the poor weather, Mr O\\'Malley said.\"We are about to see serious shortages and price hikes on these lines in the coming weeks and months,\" he said.\"The biggest issue we now have as an industry is not inflation, it\\'s mother nature,\" he added.Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers\\' Union, called for more support for growers, describing it as \"ridiculous\" that the horticulture sector was not included in the government\\'s support scheme for energy intensive industries.However, farming minister, Mark Spencer, said the shortages were the result of \"weather events in other parts of the world\" rather than the challenges facing UK producers.Complex supply chainsAnecdotal evidence suggests the UK has been bearing the brunt of the shortages, but problems have also been reported in Ireland. Tesco Ireland said its stock levels were temporarily affected, while the locally-owned chain SuperValu has also reported problems.Industry sources suggested the UK may be suffering because of lower domestic production and more complex supply chains, as well as a price-sensitive market. But they said Brexit was unlikely to be a factor.The main impact of new border procedures for fruit and vegetable imports will not be felt until January 2024 - while imports from Morocco, which is outside the EU, are already subject to border checks.Industry sources, include wholesaler Ken Mortimer, whose firm Heritage Fine Food Company supplies restaurants and schools in the south west of England, said they did not believe Brexit was at the root of current shortages.Have you been affected by issues raised here?

However, as the airline later explained, the plane was rejected because buses could not be organised to ferry the 335 passengers to a hotel.Similarly, passengers also could not disembark when the plane diverted to Osaka's Kansai Airport to refuel, because hotels could not be organised.Ultimately, the plane flew back to Tokyo where passengers had to board again the following day.Passengers online said their planned two-hour flight had turned into 16-hour ordeal. But they said they had been well compensated by the airline.One passenger on Twitter said they were given a boarding pass replacement, 20,000 yen ($148 Â£123) in cash and water during the night at the hotel. The original destination, Fukuoka Airport, has a flight ban policy between 22:00 and 07:00 because of nearby residential areas.Officials said they had allowed planes to land after the airport shutdown time if the delay is unavoidable. Such events include bad weather or runway congestion, The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported.But officials did not regard the flight's delay as unavoidable, the newspaper said.Flight data showed that other flights were allowed to land past the cut-off time that evening. Due to strong winds at Tokyo's Haneda airport earlier in the day other flights were also delayed. Flight JL 331 was the only one rejected, Bloomberg reported.Related TopicsJapan AirlinesJapanMore on this storyRunway dining at $540 a meal proving hit in Japan1 April 2021Japan Airlines to use gender-neutral greetings29 September 2020Top StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin's fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

The song, created with Tems, Ryan Coogler and Ludwig GÃ¶ransson, was featured on the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever soundtrack.It has been nominated for best original song, marking Rihanna\\'s first Oscar nod.The 95th Academy Awards ceremony will be broadcast on 12 March and hosted by Jimmy Kimmel. Earlier this month, Rihanna dazzled Super Bowl viewers with a soaring, solo half-time show, in which she publicly revealed her second pregnancy with her partner, rapper A$AP Rocky. The 13-minute performance was highly anticipated by Rihanna\\'s fans, many of whom had not seen her perform since she graced the Grammys stage in 2018 to perform \\'Wild Thoughts\\' with DJ Khaled.In the last few years, Rihanna has taken a break from music to focus on her business ventures, like her Fenty Beauty make-up brand and her Savage X Fenty lingerie line. Lift Me Up marks the first solo song Rihanna has recorded since her last album, ANTI, which was released in 2016. Speaking about her return to music after a seven-year hiatus, Rihanna said she is at a point where she wants to explore creatively. \"I\\'m feeling open to exploring, discovering, creating things that are new, things that are different, things that are off, weird. Might not ever make sense to my fans â\\x80¦ I want to have fun with music,\" Rihanna said ahead of her Super Bowl performance. With a performance at the Oscars, Rihanna joins the likes of Beyonce and Lady Gaga, who both dazzled as musical guests on the Academy Award stage in recent years. Her song, Lift Me Up, will compete for the best original song title against Lady Gaga, who is up for her fourth-ever nomination for Hold My Hand from Top Gun: Maverick.Other nominees for best original song include Diane Warren for Applause from the film Tell It Like a Woman This Is A Life from Ryan Lott, Mitski and David Byrne from the film Everything Everywhere All At Once and Naatu Naatu by M M Keeravaani and Chandrabose from the Indian action film RRR.Rihanna is a nine-time Grammy Award winner. She has eight multi-platinum albums and 14 singles that have reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.Related TopicsSuper BowlThe OscarsMusicMore on this storyRihanna reveals pregnancy at Super Bowl show13 FebruaryOscars class photo: 10 things we spotted14 FebruaryOscars 2023: The nominations in full9 FebruaryTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

But once it became clear that the secretary of state wasn\\'t coming, and that the balloon was not coming back either, the gloves were off.It is a long way from where the Chinese government wanted things to be at this moment.The US Secretary of State was supposed to be here building bridges or at least trying to stop those that still exist from being destroyed.US shoots down Chinese \\'spy\\' balloon over AtlanticWhy use a spy balloon instead of satellites?Was China balloon blown off course?Make no mistake. Chinese President Xi Jinping had great hopes for this visit and was, reportedly, even going to meet Mr Blinken himself.So what balloon-gathered intelligence could be so good that it was worth scuppering this process? The short answer is none. Which is why many analysts think that, even if it was to some extent spying, the deployment of this balloon, in this way, at this time, had to have been an error on the Chinese side. And, if that is the case, somebody is getting hauled over the coals for it, especially given that there are now two of these high-altitude balloons in play, with another floating above Latin America. There has been no word whether it too is supposed to have been blown wildly off course, given its \"limited self-steering capability\".Internationally, many seem to imagine that China\\'s Communist Party is an all-knowing, locked in, organ of power - something along the lines of a giant, efficient, supercomputer with Xi Jinping toggling the controls.It is a massive, sprawling organisation, that is certain. However, it is also made up of departments and power blocks competing for influence, at times hoarding information and even deliberately not foreshadowing their actions lest a rival gain some unwanted advantage.When a clearly visible, equipment-carrying balloon started floating close to US nuclear missile siloes, the assumption from some had been not only that it was spying but that it must have been sent as a message to the Biden administration.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Antony Blinken was expected in China on 5 and 6 FebruaryBut when you consider the damage it has done in terms of derailing a visit that the Chinese government, right up to the very top, wanted to happen, it is hard to see how this analysis stacks up.We know that the Blinken trip was important here because we saw how Beijing tried to save it using quite conciliatory language.\"The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace due to force majeure,\" a foreign ministry spokesperson was quoted as saying.The extent to which it was deployed to study the weather or spy doesn\\'t really matter in terms of understanding how crushing this incident has been for those on both sides who have been looking for ways to ease US-China tensions.An enormous breakthrough was not expected from Mr Blinken\\'s meetings in Beijing. The meetings themselves were to be the breakthrough.They would have spoken about moves towards a set of \"guard rails\", means of communication and lines not to cross in an attempt to prevent a drift towards armed conflict.President Xi also wanted it because he\\'s looking for some big signs back at home that his administration knows what it is doing when it comes to steering China into the future.A sudden and embarrassing retreat from the zero-Covid approach came just months after China\\'s leader had declared at the Party Congress that there would be no swerving from it.Then the speed of the about-face led to overcrowded hospital emergency rooms, medicine shortages and an unknown Covid death toll.The government now needs to put all this behind it and encourage an image of a China which is turning around economically and opening up again.A high-level US visit would have been quite useful in this regard.Examine the protestations from the major superpowers this week. Washington has said this was a \"clear violation of US sovereignty\" but we all know that it has plenty of its own very sophisticated means of spying on China.Beijing has condemned this US \"attack on a civilian unmanned airship\" but we all know that if a US surveillance balloon flew into Chinese airspace the People\\'s Liberation Army would have it down in no time.In a way, this means that the outrage from both sides contains a fair bit of theatre. The upside is that, now the balloon is no more, they will be able to move on from it and reschedule a Beijing visit by Mr Blinken at a time when people are asking each other, \"hey do you remember that whole balloon thing?\".Related TopicsXi JinpingAntony BlinkenChinaCommunist Party of ChinaDiplomacyUnited StatesChina-US relationsMore on this storyWhy use a spy balloon instead of satellites?3 FebruaryWas China balloon blown off course?3 FebruaryTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

There are few fish and Debabrata now makes a living growing tomatoes and brinjal.He is in no doubt what is to blame. \"Excessive shrimp farming.\"Many farmers have shifted to shrimp farming because the money is better, he says. But that involves building shrimp ponds, feeding the shrimp and treating them with antibiotics.At the end of the growing cycle - when the shrimp are ready for market - the water is flushed into the river untreated which, Debabrata says, has caused pollution.\"The water turns black and smells,\" he says. The poor quality of the water has even hit his vegetable crop.Shrimp farming has also been blamed for social and environmental problems elsewhere in the world.Despite those problems, India is unlikely to turn its back on the industry.Shrimp or prawn?Image source, AquaConnectImage caption, Farmed shrimp from IndiaCrustacean enthusiasts among you will have noticed that we have used the term shrimp throughout this piece.For many people the terms prawn and shrimp are used interchangeably. Jenny Mallinson, who ran the aquarium at the University of Southampton for 43 years, makes these distinctions:As far as the UK food industry is concerned, shrimps are small and prawns are bigIn the wild, British shrimps lie flat on the ground with the legs splayed out sideways and are grey with black spotsLive British prawns stand up on their legs, usually with a bent body and a single pointed rostrum (a beak-like point) between the eyesPrawns are also transparent, sometimes with red markings and some can take up the colour of the red or green seaweed they are living in.It should also be noted that in the US, India and other parts of the world the plural shrimp is used, rather than shrimps. Shrimp farming has helped drive up incomes in rural areas and has become a valuable export business. India is the world\\'s biggest exporter of frozen shrimp, a trade worth almost $5bn (Â£4bn) a year.But some think it could be done in a way that is less damaging to the environment.\"Around one million rural farmers and coastal communities depend on shrimp and fish aquaculture, but traditional farming practices prevent them from achieving production efficiency and fail to predict diseases,\" says Rajamanohar Somasundaram, the chief executive and co-founder of AquaConnect. Founded in 2017, AquaConnect sells an advisory service for fish farmers via an app. It has developed an artificial intelligence, which takes account of the farmer\\'s resources and can advise on the best amounts of feed to use, or how to improve water quality.The firm also offers a service which gathers data on farms that is useful for banks and insurance firms.\"The dominance of unscientific farming practices, lack of access to quality farm inputs, and identifying the right buyer to sell harvested products are always a great challenge,\" says Mr Somasundaram.Other entrepreneurs want technology to take even closer control of shrimp production.Image source, AquaConnectImage caption, Most shrimp farming in India is done in ponds like these in Jagatsinghpur in the eastern state of Odisha, or in sea cagesAt the moment, the vast majority of Indian fish and shrimp farming is done in ponds or sea cages, but there is another way.Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) involve circulating water through tanks. The water is continuously filtered and monitored, so very little is wasted.Conditions can be closely controlled, with much less risk of pollution to the local environment.With no need for a natural water source, the tanks can be located anywhere, perhaps close to big cities - a potential market for fresh produce.More technology of business:How ASML became Europeâ\\x80\\x99s most valuable tech firmThe remote Swedish town leading the green steel raceCan power-thirsty data centres be reined in?A wave of tool theft spurs hi-tech security systemsHow we fell out of love with voice assistantsShaji Baby John is the chairman and managing director of Kings Infra Ventures, one of the pioneer companies in India\\'s aquaculture industry.His firm has developed an RAS for shrimp farming and has built two pilot plants in partnership with a Japanese firm. One is outdoor, one is indoor.Because the water conditions can be tightly controlled, and the shrimp closely monitored, Mr John says his RAS can produce five shrimp cycles a year. A typical pond-based shrimp farm might only manage two.That boost in productivity means that a 1,000 sq m facility could produce up to 45 tonnes of shrimp a year. \"As it\\'s a controlled environment the production quality is better, losses are limited,\" says Mr John.But all that technology is expensive and many doubt whether RAS for shrimp will take off in India.Image source, AquaConnetImage caption, Shrimp farming in ponds has lower start-up costs than hi-tech alternatives\"There is very limited potential for RAS to become the mainstream production technology for shrimp in India,\" says Victor Suresh, president of the Society of Aquaculture Professionals.\"RAS has very high capital and operating costs,\" he points out. He says RAS might be able to compete near big cities where there might be demand for high-priced fresh and live shrimp.But at the moment that\\'s not a big market for India\\'s shrimp farmers.\"For a country like India where several hundred thousand tonnes of shrimp are raised by mostly small farmers to be processed and sold into export markets, earthen ponds provide the most economically viable option,\" he says.Mr John concedes that the initial investment costs of RAS farming are high, but says the quality of fish from his RAS systems is better and the cost per shrimp is lower than in traditional ponds.Also, by using solar panels for electricity, he says the new facilities should have a low carbon footprint.\"We have gone for aquaculture focusing fully on sustainable and eco-friendly practices with zero antibiotics and zero wastage,\" he says.But AquaConnect\\'s Rajamanohar Somasundaram says shrimp farmers are a cautious group.\"Shrimp farming is a high-risk and high-reward sector. Technology solutions in the sector have to be precise or else they will result in heavy losses. This could be the reason why farmers are sceptical about technology.\"Related TopicsIndiaFish FarmingTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

Not the full-scale war that has bombed civilians across Ukraine and left more than 13 million either as refugees abroad or displaced inside their own country. His declared goal on 24 February 2022 was to \"demilitarise and denazify\" Ukraine and not occupy it by force, days after backing independence for eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014. He vowed to protect people from eight years of Ukrainian bullying and genocide - a Russian propaganda claim with no foundation in reality. He spoke of preventing Nato from gaining a foothold in Ukraine, then added another objective of ensuring Ukraine\\'s neutral status.President Putin never said it out loud, but high on the agenda was toppling the government of Ukraine\\'s elected president. \"The enemy has designated me as target number one my family is target number two,\" said Volodymyr Zelensky. Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound, according to his adviser. Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide never added up, but Russian state-run news agency Ria Novosti explained that \"denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation\" - in effect, erasing the modern state of Ukraine.For years, the Russian president has denied Ukraine its own statehood, writing in a lengthy 2021 essay that \"Russians and Ukrainians were one people\" dating back to the late 9th Century.In Kherson: Joy, tears and talk of justiceHow Putin changed his war aimsA month into the invasion and his campaign goals were dramatically scaled back after a retreat from Kyiv and Chernihiv. The main goal became the \"liberation of Donbas\" - broadly referring to Ukraine\\'s two industrial regions in the east of Luhansk and Donetsk.Forced into further retreats from Kharkiv in the north-east and Kherson in the south, that aim remains unchanged, but it has shown little success in achieving it.Those reverses on the battlefield rushed Russia\\'s leader into annexing four Ukrainian provinces last September, without having full control of any of them: neither Luhansk or Donetsk in the east, nor Kherson or Zaporizhzhia to the south. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Vladimir Putin celebrated annexing Ukrainian territory: \"Together forever\" is written at the top of the screenTo bolster his depleted forces President Putin announced Russia\\'s first mobilisation since World War Two, although it was partial and limited to some 300,000 reservists. A war of attrition is now taking place along an active front line of 850km (530 miles) and Russian victories are small and rare. What was meant to be a quick operation is now a protracted war that Western leaders are determined Ukraine should win. Any realistic prospect of neutrality for Ukraine is long gone.Russia must be defeated but not crushed - MacronPresident Putin warned in December that the war \"could be a lengthy process\", but then added later that Russia\\'s goal was \"not to spin the flywheel of military conflict\", but to end it. There is little hope of that on the horizon.A year into the war, he talks of Russia fighting to defend its \"historical frontiers\" and \"rebuilding peaceful life in Donbas and Novorossiya\", spelling out that Ukraine\\'s southern territories are part of his project, just as much as the east.What gains has Russia made?The biggest success President Putin can lay claim to is establishing a land bridge from Russia\\'s border to Crimea, annexed illegally in 2014, so it is no longer reliant on its bridge over the Kerch Strait. He has spoken of the capture of this territory, which includes the cities of Mariupol and Melitopol, as a \"significant result for Russia\". The Sea of Azov, inside the Kerch Strait, \"has become Russia\\'s internal sea\", he declared, pointing out that even Russian Tsar Peter the Great did not manage that. Tracking the war in mapsIs Russia losing the war?Beyond seizing a territorial corridor to Crimea, Russia\\'s bloody, unprovoked war has been a disaster for itself and the country it was unleashed on. So far, it has achieved little more than exposing the brutality and inadequacy of the Russian military.While cities such as Mariupol were flattened, details of war crimes have emerged against civilians in Bucha, near Kyiv, and have led to an independent report that accused Russia itself of state-orchestrated incitement to genocide.But it is the military failures that have shown Russia at its weakest:The retreat of 30,000 Russian troops across the Dnipro river from Kherson in November was a strategic failureA 56km (35-mile) armoured convoy that ground to a halt near Kyiv at the start of the war was a logistical failureThe deaths of a large number of recently mobilised troops in a Ukrainian new-year missile attack on Makiivka were an intelligence failureThe sinking of the flagship Black Sea battle cruiser the Moskva was a defensive failure, as was the spectacular attack in October 2022 that shut the Kerch Strait bridge for weeks.Russia\\'s warnings to the West against arming Ukraine have gone unheeded, with Western assurances of support \"for as long as it takes\" and pledges that Nato will never be divided. Superior US Himars missiles helped turn the course of the war and German Leopard 2 tanks are promised, even if Western fighter jets are not. A succession of Western leaders, including President Joe Biden, have made the complex journey to Kyiv.But this war is not over. The fight for Donbas continues. Russia has captured the town of Soledar this year and has hopes of seizing the eastern city of Bakhmut on the road to key cities to the west, and of recapturing territory it lost last autumn.Putin watchers believe he will seek to extend control of the four regions that he has declared to be part of Russia, not just in Donbas, but towards the key city of Zaporizhzhia.Should he need to, President Putin could extend mobilisation and drag out the war. Russia is a nuclear power and he has indicated he would be prepared, if necessary, to use nuclear weapons to protect Russia and cling on to occupied Ukrainian land. \"We will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff,\" he warned.Image source, BBC/Goktay KoraltanImage caption, Ukrainian troops are doggedly holding on to Bakhmut amid fierce Russian attacksKyiv believes Russia is also seeking to depose the pro-European government in Moldova, where Russian troops are based in the breakaway region of Transnistria bordering Ukraine.Can we say how many Russians have died?Neither Russia nor Ukraine give details of their own losses, so reliable numbers are extremely difficult. But Russians losses have been especially heavy in recent weeks, with several hundred deaths every day on the battlefields of the east.BBC Russian has identified more than 15,000 Russian soldiers killed in the first year of war and suggests the most conservative estimate would be at least double that, with more than 100,000 others wounded or missing.UK defence intelligence believes Russian casualties increased significantly after partial mobilisation, reaching 175-200,000 in total, of whom 40-60,000 were killed.Ukraine revealed at the end of 2022 that 10-13,000 of its soldiers had been killed since the start of the war. That figure cannot be confirmed, but it followed a US estimate of some 100,000 Ukrainians killed or wounded by November. Before Western artillery arrived in the east last summer, Kyiv officials said 100 to 200 troops were dying every day.The UN human rights commissioner says at least 8,006 civilians have died and 13,287 have been wounded in 12 months of war, but the true number is likely to be substantially higher.Has Putin been damaged?President Putin, 70, has sought to distance himself from military failures, but his authority, at least outside Russia, has been shredded and he makes few trips beyond its borders.At home, Russia\\'s economy on the surface appears to have weathered a series of Western sanctions for now, although its budget deficit has soared and oil and gas revenue has fallen dramatically.Any attempt to gauge his popularity is fraught with difficulty.Dissent in Russia is highly risky, with jail sentences handed out for anyone spreading \"fake news\" about the Russian military. Those opposing Russia\\'s leadership have either fled or, as with main opposition figure Alexei Navalny, been thrown into prison.Ukraine\\'s shift to the WestThe seeds of this war were sown in 2013, when Moscow persuaded Ukraine\\'s pro-Russian leader to scrap a planned pact with the European Union, prompting protests that ultimately brought him down and led to Russia seizing Crimea and staging a land-grab in the east.Four months into Russia\\'s 2022 invasion, the EU granted Ukraine candidate status and Kyiv is pushing to be accepted as soon as it can.Russia\\'s long-time leader was also desperate to prevent Ukraine from entering Nato\\'s orbit, but his attempt to blame the Western defensive alliance for the war is false.Not only did Ukraine reportedly agree before the war a provisional deal with Russia to stay out of Nato but, in March, President Zelensky offered to maintain Ukraine as a non-aligned, non-nuclear state: \"It\\'s a truth and it must be recognised.\"How will the war end?No end is currently in sight. Ukraine\\'s position is that Russian troops must pull back beyond Ukraine\\'s internationally recognised borders for there to be peace. It is backed by two UN resolutions, passed days after the invasion and hours before the first anniversary of the war.By annexing four regions Russia does not even fully control, Vladimir Putin has made it very hard for himself to give them up.There is little prospect for now of a ceasefire or peace talks. Turkey had some success last summer with the UN in mediating a deal on resuming grain exports through the Black Sea but has had no success since. China is looking for a role in securing a political settlement, but its position is probably too close to Russia to be considered an honest broker.Was Nato to blame for the war?Nato member states have increasingly sent Ukraine air defence systems to protect its cities, as well as missile systems, artillery and drones that helped turn the tide against Russia\\'s invasion.But it is not to blame for the war and has no troops on the ground. Nato\\'s expansion comes as a response to the Russian threat - Sweden and Finland only applied to join because of the invasion. Blaming Nato\\'s expansion eastwards is a Russian narrative that has gained some ground in Europe. Before the war, President Putin demanded Nato turn the clock back to 1997 and remove its forces and military infrastructure from Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics.In his eyes, the West promised back in 1990 that Nato would expand \"not an inch to the east\", yet did so anyway. That was before the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, so the promise made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev referred merely to East Germany in the context of a reunified Germany.Mr Gorbachev said later that \"the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed\" at the time.Nato maintains it never intended to deploy combat troops on its eastern flank, until Russia annexed Crimea illegally in 2014.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, From May: Sweden and Finland formally submit Nato applicationsWhat are your questions about the war in Ukraine?

Leading MP Doina Gherman told Moldovan media that the Russian allegations were \"aggressive disinformation\". There was no imminent threat and she urged the public to trust the government.Moldovan President Maia Sandu, on a visit to neighbouring Romania on Thursday, spoke of unprecedented security challenges ahead. \"Some wanted our country to fall and to install in Chisinau a puppet government enslaved to the interests of the Kremlin,\" she said.Moldova is not part of Nato but last June it was awarded EU candidate status on the same day as Ukraine, bringing it one step closer to joining the bloc. Earlier this week the Moldovan leader met US President Joe Biden, who promised to support her country\\'s sovereignty.However, on Moldova\\'s eastern flank lies a narrow strip of land called Transnistria, between the Dniester river and the Ukrainian border. This breakaway region has a contingent of Russian peacekeepers, and Moscow has warned that any threat to its security will be treated as an attack on Russia itself.Challenges created by war in UkraineWith a population of just 2.6 million, Moldova is one of Europe\\'s poorest economies and has been heavily exposed to the war in Ukraine.It has faced a major energy crisis because its power infrastructure dates back to the Soviet era. Not only did Russia restrict its gas supplies but its attacks on Ukraine\\'s power grid had knock-on effects.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Watch: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 secondsRampant inflation and a big influx of refugees from Ukraine have created further pressures, leading to protests organised by the populist and pro-Russian Sor party, led by fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor. There has also been an apparent escalation of incidents described by new Prime Minister Dorin Recean as \"hybrid attacks\". A Russian missile was fired at Ukraine through Moldovan airspace on the day the previous government collapsed earlier this month, in the face of what the former PM called \"multiple crises\".Moldovan government resigns after multiple crisesPresident Sandu has accused Russia of plotting to bring down Moldova\\'s leadership with the aid of foreign saboteurs from Russia, Serbia, Belarus and Montenegro. She said their aim would be to attack government buildings, seize hostages and then spark protests to replace the government with one \"at the service of Russia\".Shortly after her speech, twelve Serbian football fans were barred from entering Chisinau for a match. Fighters of a boxing club from Montenegro were barred from entering Chisinau for a tournament too.The Kremlin accused Moldova\\'s leaders of slipping into anti-Russian hysteria and warned them to be \"very, very careful\" with their statements.Political analyst Denis Cenusa said Moldova\\'s weakest point for pro-Russian forces was its internal socio-economic stability. If Russia failed in the short term, he said it could succeed at the ballot box in local elections this year and the presidential vote in 2024.Find a solution for TransnistriaDominated by Russian speakers, Transnistria proclaimed independence from Moldova in 1990 as the Soviet Union fell apart. A short border war led to a ceasefire in 1992 and that has been enforced ever since by 1,500 Russian troops stationed there.As long as Transnistria\\'s future remains unclear, tensions will remain. Moldova\\'s new prime minister sees demilitarising the area as a priority and the foreign ministry has said it will continue to seek a peaceful solution.But President Putin has pointedly revoked a 2012 decree committing Russia to finding a solution for Transnistria based on respect for Moldova\\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity.As soon as Russian forces invaded southern Ukraine a year ago there were fears they would try to seize Odesa and the entire coast to Transnistria. That has not happened, but what Moldova\\'s leaders are warning of now is reminiscent of what happened in April 2022.A series of mysterious explosions were reported, which separatist authorities in Transnistria said targeted their state security HQ, old Soviet-era radio masts and a military unit.Ukrainian \"infiltrators\" were held responsible then as well by Transnistria\\'s authorities. Kyiv blamed Russian special services, warning they were seeking to threaten Moldova and destabilise the situation.Earlier this week a pro-separatist social media channel said it had seen Ukrainian military equipment on the motorway linking Ukraine to Moldova, but an unconvincing photo showed only a couple of small armoured vehicles and a Ukrainian flag.Russia\\'s defence ministry claimed it had detected a \"significant amount of [Ukrainian] personnel and military vehicles\" near Transnistria and said they carried a direct threat to Russia\\'s peacekeeping force, but again it offered no evidence.The head of Transnistria\\'s peacekeeping body, Oleg Belyakov, said there was no panic among its population but Russia\\'s warnings did \"give reasons for serious concerns\".Related TopicsRussia-Ukraine warMoldovaRomaniaUkraineMore on this storyEU awards Ukraine and Moldova candidate status23 June 2022Explosions hit Transnistria: Is war spreading?27 April 2022Moldova wary of protests fanned by pro-Russian party4 days agoMoldova braces for blackouts from Ukraine war29 November 2022Top StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

Cases have been found in Durham, Cheshire and Cornwall in England Powys in Wales Shetland, the Inner Hebrides and Fife, Scotland.It is believed they had fed on dead or sick wild birds infected with the virus. The animals were found to have a mutation of the virus that could make it easier to infect mammals, but there was no evidence of transmission between mammals. The APHA added that there was \"a very low likelihood of any widespread infection in GB mammals\".Why is bird flu so bad this year?Anti-Bird flu measures in place across Great BritainProf Ian Brown, APHA\\'s director of scientific services, said: \"A sick or a dead wild bird contains an awful lot of virus. So scavenging mammals that will be opportunistic and predate on dead or sick birds will be exposed to very large quantities of virus. That gives a possibility for the virus to enter a host population that it doesn\\'t normally maintain in.\"Prof Brown said that the UK\\'s national avian flu taskforce was now ramping up its surveillance of cases in mammals and genome analysis of the virus itself while keeping a close eye on its spread in global populations of wild birds.\"The virus is absolutely on the march. And it\\'s almost remarkable - it\\'s a single strain,\" he said, adding that greater international action to tackle its spread was needed.He told the BBC he was \"acutely aware of the risks\" of avian flu becoming a pandemic like Covid-19.He said: \"This global spread is a concern. We do need globally to look at new strategies, those international partnerships, to get on top of this disease.\"If we don\\'t solve the problem across the globe, we\\'re going to continue to have that risk.\"Image source, APHAImage caption, Prof Ian Brown says there needs to be closer international co-operationSince October 2021, when the latest outbreak began, there have been five confirmed human cases of the H5N1 virus, including one in the UK, and one death, in China. Last month, a nine-year old girl in Ecuador was found to be infected with avian influenza A(H5). The World Health Organization (WHO) said that, in the past 20 years, there have been almost 870 cases of human infection with the avian influenza H5N1 virus reported from 21 countries. Of these, 457 were fatal.It said the virus has \"not acquired the ability for sustained transmission among humans. Thus the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low.\"But it added: \"Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health, and timely virus-sharing for risk assessment.\"Dr Wenqing Zhang, the head of WHO\\'s global influenza programme, said of the threat posed by the virus spilling over: \"It is very concerning and the risk has been increasing over the years as reflected in the number of outbreaks in animals as well as a number of infections in humans.\"Intergovernmental organisation the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) told the BBC it has recorded almost 42 million individual cases in domestic and wild birds since the outbreak began in October 2021.Almost 15 million domestic birds, including poultry, have died from the disease, and more than 193 million more have been culled.It also shows 119 outbreaks affecting mammals, with about 200 individual cases recorded - although a WOAH spokesperson warned the spread to mammals was likely to be under-reported.Dr Gregorio Torres, WOAH\\'s head of science, said there had been an increase in reports of non-avian species being affected by the virus over the past 18 months.He said it \"could be a signal of very sensitive surveillance - an indicator that we are doing a good job\".But he added: \"On the other hand, it could also be an indicator that there is a change in the epidemiology of the disease or a change in the dynamic of the disease. And that will require close monitoring. \"There is a risk for further transmission between species and we cannot underestimate the potential adaptation to humans.\"In a recent report, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) warned that the \"rapid and consistent acquisition of the mutation in mammals may imply this virus has a propensity to cause zoonotic infections\", meaning it could jump to humans.The agency also raised concerns about limited wild bird and mammal surveillance and genomic data collection in England, and warned that there was not enough testing of people who had been contact with infected birds.It is now looking to develop new ways of testing humans who have been exposed to the disease but may be asymptomaticDr Meera Chand, incident director for avian influenza at UKHSA, said: \"Latest evidence suggests that the avian influenza viruses currently circulating in birds do not spread easily to people. We remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk.\"There have recently been some detections of avian influenza viruses in a small number of mammals in the UK. However, the risk assessment conducted by UKHSA and partners did not identify any signals of increased risk to the general public from avian influenza at present.\" Meanwhile, the public is being warned not to touch any dead or sick birds, but to report any dead birds of prey, three or more dead wild waterfowl or gulls or five or more dead birds of any species that they find to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.Related TopicsPublic healthMore on this storyBird flu found in two dead swans24 JanuaryBird flu outbreak prompts protection zone18 JanuaryBird centre would close if exposed to avian flu16 JanuaryWhy is bird flu so bad this year?2 FebruaryUK virus research site left to deteriorate - MPs16 November 2022UK taskforce set up to tackle bird flu spread20 June 2022View commentsTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

This is on top of existing international economic sanctions over Pyongyang\\'s nuclear programme. Imagine a North Korean family...North Korea\\'s sidelined human rights crisisThe South Koreans enslaved in the North\\'s minesWhat did Kim say?In a rare admission of looming hardship, the authoritarian leader of the single-party state on Thursday called on officials to \"wage another, more difficult \\'Arduous March\\' in order to relieve our people of the difficulty, even a little\".The Arduous March is a term used by North Korea officials to refer to the country\\'s struggle during the 1990s famine, when the fall of the Soviet Union left North Korea without crucial aid. The total number of North Koreans who starved to death is not known, but estimates range up to 3 million.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, North Korea often struggles to feed its people\"It is not unusual for Kim Jong-un to talk about difficulties and hardship but this time the language is quite stark and that\\'s different,\" Colin Zwirko, North Korea analyst at NK News, told the BBC. \"Last October for instance, he gave a speech where he said that he himself failed to bring about enough changes. But mentioning explicitly that he\\'s decided to carry out a new Arduous March is not something he has said before.\"Earlier this week, Mr Kim had warned the country faced the \"worst-ever situation\" and \"unprecedentedly numerous challenges\".How bad is the situation? There have been warnings for months that the people of North Korea are struggling.Reports of hardship appear to be coming especially from towns near the Chinese border, where smuggling would have been a huge earner for many.The price of corn, the staple diet for most of rural North Korea, has reportedly fluctuated enormously and at times a kilogram of corn has cost more than a month\\'s wages.Lina Yoon, a researcher from Human Rights Watch (HRW), said in a recent report citing unnamed contacts in the country that \"there is barely any food going into the country from China\".\"There are so many more beggars, some people died from hunger in the border area, and there\\'s no soap, toothpaste, or batteries,\" she wrote. What\\'s it like to live in North Korea?Russians leave North Korea on hand-pushed trolleyThe UN Special Rapporteur on North Korean Human Rights, TomÃ¡s Ojea Quintana, warned last month in a report of a \"serious food crisis\" already leading to malnourishment and starvation.\"Deaths by starvation have been reported, as has an increase in the number of children and elderly people who have resorted to begging as families are unable to support them.\" It is unclear whether any aid at all is currently coming into the country. North Korea has rejected offers of external aid and almost all diplomats and aid workers, including staff of the UN\\'s World Food Programme (WFP), have left.Meanwhile North Korea\\'s border closures means trade with China dropped by 80% last year from levels that had already fallen significantly in 2018 when the UN expanded sanctions over North Korea\\'s nuclear programme. Reports suggest North Korea restricted imports of staple foods from China last August and then cut almost all trade, including food and medicines, in October.The country has also ramped up punishments for smuggling, describing it as \"anti-socialist\" and \"enemy\" behaviour, according to HRW.North Korea was also hit by two major storms last summer, which caused flooding that is believed to have damaged crops, exacerbating the shortages.Kim Jong-un is shoring up support within his party as times get tough. He\\'s making sure that the warnings are coming from him - perhaps so that when things get worse, he can point the finger at his officials for not acting on his orders.He can also pin blame for the dire economy on the Covid-19 pandemic and the strict economic sanctions designed to curb his nuclear weapons programme.And yet his regime continues to design and test new missiles.The weapons tests are something we can all see on satellite images and state media photos, and use them to question world leaders about how they are going to act.The North Korean people cannot get images of their suffering to us without the risk of being imprisoned or shot.Unseen, and according to warnings by their own leader, they now face going hungry amid a looming humanitarian crisis.Why is North Korea in trouble?Tightly controlled by the government, North Korea\\'s economy is one of the least free in the world and is said to be highly inefficient. The enormous cost of maintaining the military and security structures has left very little for the ordinary North Korean. The almost complete border closure aims to prevent the coronavirus from spreading in a country that does not have the public health infrastructure to handle an outbreak.However there are indications that Pyongyang is feeling pressure to reopen borders at least a bit, Mr Zwirko said. \"North Korea has shown signs of wanting to increase trade with China again. They have passed a law a few months ago to help facilitate border trade,\" he said.\"But fundamentally, North Korea remains extremely paranoid about the virus. They\\'d really have to change and trust in the ability to disinfect goods that would come through.\"North Korea claims that so far the border shutdown has kept it Covid-free, though analysts doubt this claim.

And it\\'s ticking for government - to start putting meaningful, tangible and effective meat on the bones of the commitments it has made.\"The NFU has previously warned many farms have cut production to limit losses from high inflation and energy bills, which could threaten domestic food security and supply.\\'Empty sheds\\'NFU Cymru deputy president Abi Reader told BBC News shoppers could be seeing less choice when it came to British food on the supermarket shelves.\"There are empty sheds out there that should be growing fruit and veg,\" she said.\"There are empty sheds that should have poultry in them to produce eggs - and this food just isn\\'t coming through the system.\"We have got massive rising costs. A lot of this is due to the war in Ukraine, some of it is that we are still trying to settle down after Brexit - but these rising input costs are so high farmers just can\\'t afford them. \"Banks are worried about lending, so people have just contracted - businesses are producing less than they used to do.\"\\'Rural vote\\'Prime Minister Rishi Sunak addressed Tuesday\\'s conference in Birmingham on \\'Feeding a changing world\\', in a pre-recorded message.Farming minister Mark Spencer told delegates more than Â£168m in grants would be available for the development of new technology, as well as improved food production and animal welfare, in the year ahead.They will sit alongside the government\\'s Environmental Land Management Scheme (ELMS) payments, as part of a total annual package of Â£2.4bn in public funding for farming.He said: \"We know that sustainable food production depends on a healthy environment, the two go hand in hand. \"Helping farms invest in new technology as well as bringing in nature-friendly schemes will support the future of farming.\" ELMS is a post-Brexit farm payment scheme designed to reward landowners and farmers in England for environmental work. It is designed to replace the European Union\\'s common agricultural policy subsidies.Mr Spencer also told delegates that foreign seasonal farm workers would be paid a minimum of the national living wage in the year ahead - set to be Â£10.42 from 1 April - and guaranteed a minimum of 32 hours of work every week.He said: \"That\\'s the decent thing to do - and I think it is vital that we all stick to it.\"Mrs Batters welcomed the announcement, saying it gave farmers \"clarity\".Meanwhile, she said that \"the rural vote will be crucial in the next election\" and she would not \"let the opposition off the hook\".Speaking at the conference, Sir Keir Starmer promised that Labour would overhaul the government\\'s procurement policy so that 50% of all food purchased by the public sector would be locally produced and sustainable - a policy, he said, that would be worth Â£1.2bn of public money a year.\"And 50% is just the minimum,\" he said. \"We will do everything to go beyond it. We will buy more cereals, more oilseed rape, more strawberries, more beef and more British apples, and we will open up new opportunities to export them as well.\"He also promised a better trading relationship for farmers with the EU.The government said its trade deals would see UK farmers and food producers benefit from new opportunities to sell abroad, while animal welfare and food-safety standards would be maintained.Related TopicsDepartment for Environment, Food & Rural AffairsNFUMore on this storyUK sleepwalking into food crisis, farmers warn6 December 2022Why is there an egg shortage?30 November 2022UK\\'s farming policies contradictory, says NFU head22 February 2022View commentsTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

The White House\\'s fresh round of aid for Ukraine is worth $2bn (Â£1.7bn).A further $550m (Â£459m) will be supplied to both Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova to strengthen their energy infrastructure.\"One year on, the commitment of the United States, together with some 50 countries who have rallied to rush urgently needed assistance to Ukraine, has only strengthened,\" the Department of Defense said.Just how much money is the US spending on Ukraine?Moldova warns of Russian \\'psy-ops\\' as tensions riseIn a press release, the White House said the new measures were designed to disrupt Russian financial institutions, officials and authorities from \"illegitimately operating in Ukraine\".It comes days after US President Joe Biden flew into Kyiv for a surprise visit and held talks with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky. In its latest round of aid, the US government is providing Ukraine with new drone systems, high-mobility rocket systems, ammunition for artillery systems and communications gear. Earlier this week the US said China was considering supplying lethal weapons to Russia. They also claimed Chinese firms had already been supplying non-lethal dual-use technology - items which could have both civilian and military uses, such as drones and semi-conductors.China has strongly denied the allegations.Why China launched a charm offensive over UkraineA meeting of G7 leaders was held on Friday, where they created an enforcement team designed to stop Russia from finding sanctions loopholes.\"G7 countries will continue to keep Russia\\'s sovereign assets immobilised until there is a resolution to the conflict\", the group said in a press release.The G7 - group of seven - is an organisation of the world\\'s seven largest \"advanced\" economies. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. It has so far committed $39b (Â£32b) to Ukraine\\'s war efforts for 2023. The US said G7 countries and allies would also impose sanctions on key economic sectors in Russia - including its metals and mining sector.\"Our actions today with our G7 partners show that we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said.The US added that it would provide Ukraine with electrical grid equipment to protect its energy supply from Russian strikes, and with generators to provide back-up power.ÂThe White House will provide Moldova, which borders Ukraine and heavily relies on Russian gas, with $300m (Â£250m) to help increase its local power generation.Moldova is Europe\\'s poorest country and has been heavily impacted by the war. Its leaders have warned for several weeks that Russia is plotting to seize power.

After years of stalemate, following failed nuclear talks, tensions on the Korean peninsula are rising.\"I thought about getting an axe, but I decided it would be too difficult to carry, so I settled for a knife.\" Sitting in a dimly-lit cocktail bar, late one night, Jenn recounts her detailed escape plan. As a South Korean, living in Seoul, she knew exactly what she would do if the North attacked. First came the weapons, then two motorbikes: one for her, the other for her brother. Their parents would ride on the back. This way they could cross the city\\'s river quickly, before the North Koreans bombed the bridges, and hopefully make it to the coast before the port was destroyed. One evening she and her brother sat and mapped their route, agreeing to tie ribbons to the trees should they be separated.This was five years ago. At the time, North Korea was furiously testing missiles that could, in theory, deliver nuclear bombs to the United States, and its then President Donald Trump was threatening to respond with \"fire and fury\". Jenn admits she was more worried than most. But nonetheless, this was the closest many South Koreans felt they had come to war since fighting with North Korea ended almost 70 years ago.Then something remarkable happened. South Korea\\'s newly-elected president at the time, Moon Jae-in, convinced Mr Trump to meet Kim Jong-un. It was the first time a sitting US president had ever met the leader of North Korea. A flurry of historic summits followed, sparking hope that the North might just agree to give up its nuclear weapons, and the two Koreas would make peace. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un briefly met at the Korean demilitarized zone (DMZ)Excitement fizzed as President Moon, the son of North Korean refugees, arrived in the Capital Pyongyang and stepped out into a packed stadium, grasping the hand of his adversary. The audience didn\\'t know what to do, recalls Prof Moon Chung-in, the president\\'s advisor at the time. They had been told this man was their enemy, yet here he was on their soil, proposing peace. Suddenly, the 150,000 North Korean spectators erupted in raucous applause. \"It was amazing to watch, it was a very moving moment for me,\" he says.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The North Korean crowd burst into applause after being addressed by President Moon Jae-inBut as President Moon leaves office, the hopes of that year lie in tatters. When a nuclear deal between the United States and North Korea collapsed in 2019, so did talks between the Koreas. There has been a stalemate ever since. Meanwhile North Korea has continued to develop its weapons of mass destruction and is once again testing them with alarming frequency. Only this time, the pandemic and now the war in Ukraine mean the eyes of the world have been focused elsewhere.Asked if the government failed, Prof Moon Chung-in is defensive. \"No, I don\\'t think so! Was there war?\" He reasons that for five years the Moon government kept the peace during one of the biggest crises in inter-Korean relations. It also showed what incentives would get North Korea to the negotiating table. The problem, he believes, is that North Korean negotiators returned empty-handed, in what was a great embarrassment for the regime, and almost certainly a punishable offence.President Moon tried everything he could to coax the North Koreans back to talks, but in doing so he has been accused of appeasing one of the world\\'s most brutal dictators.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Kim Jong-un and President Moon Jae-in met three times in 2018\"When I saw those pictures of them with their arms around each other laughing, it sent shivers down my back,\" remembers Hanna Song, from her office in downtown Seoul. Her organisation, the Database Centre for North Korean Human Rights, has been tracking human rights violations in North Korea for more than two decades. The last few years have not been easy.Human rights are Kim Jong-un\\'s Achilles\\' heel, Hanna explains. She says that in an effort to stop the North Korean leader from feeling uncomfortable, President Moon \"swept them under the rug\".Image source, BBC/Hosu LeeImage caption, Hanna Song believes vital evidence of human rights abuses has been lostHanna\\'s organisation interviews North Korean escapees at Hanawon, the resettlement centre where they live for their first three months in the country. Their testimonies play a vital role in documenting human rights abuses. But two years ago, the South Korean government cut off their access to the centre, meaning they could no longer gather their evidence. Then Hanna started hearing from escapees that they were being pressured not to speak publicly about their experiences in North Korea. Some received calls from the local policemen assigned to help them assimilate. \"Are you sure it\\'s wise to be doing this?\" they asked. Hanna tried challenging the government over the missing information. \"What are you going to do when there is this gap in evidence, just because you wanted to make sure Kim Jong-un wasn\\'t being shamed in front of the international community?\" she would ask, to little response. \"What\\'s happening in Ukraine is horrendous,\" Hanna concludes, \"but at least we know.\"Frighteningly little is known about the current situation in North Korea. Its self-imposed coronavirus border closure has stopped people, and therefore information, from leaving. What is clear is that Kim Jong-un has continued developing nuclear weapons, in spite of numerous international sanctions designed to stop him from doing so. His weapons are becoming more sophisticated and dangerous. In March, the regime tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time since the summits of 2018 began, and it flew further and for longer than any of its previously tested missiles.Image source, KCNAImage caption, Kim Jong-un pictured in front of North Korea\\'s largest known intercontinental ballistic missileBut the hugs and handshakes are over. South Korea has elected a new, tough-talking President, a former prosecutor with no prior political experience. In a recent interview Yoon Suk-yeol described North Korea as the \"main enemy\" of the South and has promised to take a hard-line approach to its military escalations. He will only talk to his neighbour, he has said, if North Korea shows it is serious about denuclearisation. But most experts now agree that North Korea has zero intention of giving up its nuclear weapons. It had reached this conclusion long before the war in Ukraine highlighted the perils of relinquishing such weapons, though this certainly has not helped. This gives Mr Yoon\\'s strategy \"zero chance of working\" according to Chris Green, a consultant for the International Crisis Group, an organisation working to prevent wars.Image source, News1Image caption, South Korea\\'s incoming conservative President Yoon Suk-yeol is promising to take a hard line on North KoreaDuring his campaign, Mr Yoon went as far as to say he would a launch a pre-emptive strike on North Korea, to destroy its weapons, if there were signs the North was about to mount an attack. This has long been part of South Korea\\'s defence strategy, but it is rarely uttered out loud as it is a sure-fire way to enrage the North - which it did. Last month North Korea paraded its missiles through the streets, in its latest attempted show of strength. Kim Jong-un, dressed in a white military uniform, delivered a blistering warning: any hostile force that threatened North Korea, would \"cease to exist\". This was interpreted, at least in part, as a warning to the new South Korean president.Image source, KCNAImage caption, The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un hosting a military parade in Pyongyang in AprilThe North has been developing an array of short-range missiles which, for the first time last month, it hinted could be used to carry tactical nukes - the sort which could be used against South Korea in a conventional war. There are now signs it is about to test one of these nuclear bombs.But Chris Green still believes North Korea\\'s main goal is survival. \"If it were to use a nuclear weapon, under any circumstance, it would spell the end of the regime, and North Korea knows that,\" he explains. Instead, Mr Green predicts an arms race between the North and South, with both building up their arsenal and testing them more frequently. These actions shouldn\\'t lead to war, but they could lead to a miscalculation by either side. That is the biggest danger at the moment, he thinks.Crouched around a smoking barbeque, down a back alley in Seoul, Lee Geon-il clinks glasses with his friends and they knock back their first soju of the night. \"Does it taste sweet yet?\" he jokes, referring to the Korean saying that the spirit turns sweet after a hard day or a hard life.\"Anything I drink at this point will be sweet,\" Lee Si-yeol replies. Typically, South Koreans don\\'t pay much attention to North Korea, comforted by a belief that the United States is its real target. But Si-yeol is also about to start his compulsory military service, and as tension on the peninsula creeps up, he is struggling to shake his fear. \"I know I\\'m unusual, but it does concern me when Kim Jong-un shoots a missile,\" he says. \"I do worry this new hard-line policy we are adopting might provoke some sort of conflict.\"Image source, BBC/Hosu LeeImage caption, Lee Si-yeol and Lee Geon-il enjoy an evening together before starting their compulsory military serviceLee Geon-il worries too. He didn\\'t use to, he says, but the war in Ukraine has caused him to think the same could happen here. He will be an officer and admits he cannot imagine having to lead his men in an actual war. But he supports the new president. \"We need to respond strongly to them saying they will use nuclear weapons, the threat is so close.\"As Prof Moon Chung-in stands overlooking the presidential office, he reflects on their failed diplomacy. \"The future is bleak,\" he concludes. \"I can\\'t see a breakthrough, not in my lifetime. We missed our opportunity.\"Image source, Moon Chung-inImage caption, Prof Moon Chung-in drinks soju with Kim Jong-un\\'s sister, Kim Yo-jong, during one of the inter-Korean summitsThere is unease in Seoul about what is coming, as North Korea inevitably tests the limits of the new government and tries to claw its way back up the international agenda. \"I am bracing myself,\" a former South Korean Lieutenant General admitted, in private.The world might be looking elsewhere, but North Korea is getting harder to ignore.Related TopicsNorth Korea-US relationsNorth Korea weapons programmeSouth KoreaNorth Koreaâ\\x80\\x93South Korea relationsLong ReadsNorth KoreaTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

She said she quit the sport with her \"mentality ruined\" and spent years trying to recover.\"I tell [stories] to my friends and family and they can\\'t believe it. It\\'s utterly disgraceful that it went on,\" she said.The BBC has spoken to multiple swimmers, several parents, and coaches who allege mistreatment at clubs across England.Allegations stretching back more than a decade include bullying, fat-shaming, emotional abuse, being allowed to train while injured, being belittled, an obsession with weight, and failing to tackle eating disorders.\\'Winning medals but felt worthless\\'Louise Graham, regional development manager for Swim England North East, said she was aware of multiple examples of victim-shaming and bullying, alongside an \"outdated\" attitude that athletes needed to toughen up to succeed.\"People uncritically adopt bad practice [that] \\'if it was fine 20 years ago, it\\'s fine now - this is what\\'s required to be an Olympic champion and that\\'s it\\',\" she said. \"But that view is so irresponsible and it needs to change.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The BBC has been inundated with reports of malpractice at all levels of the sportIn February 2022 it was revealed by the BBC that Shropshire\\'s elite Ellesmere College Titans swimming club would close following a year-long probe into more than 70 complaints from swimmers that included bullying, fat-shaming, emotional abuse and a failure to tackle self-harm.Since then, the BBC has been inundated with reports of malpractice at all levels of the sport, although many victims are scared to speak out.Allegations include: Swimmers losing so much weight their periods stoppedOne teenager being told to keep exercising with a broken rib so she could continue \"fat-burning sessions\"One club forcing children to train for hours without water on weigh-in days so fluid retention would not affect the scalesChildren sworn and shouted at for poor performance often linked to exhaustion and lack of nutritionThe BBC has also seen evidence that a machine used to track one swimmer\\'s weight at the age of 15 had a false date of birth inputted for her because it was meant for adults only.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Phoebe says a coach pointed at parts of her body and said she\\'d put on weightFormer GB swimmer Phoebe won national competitions, competed in the European Juniors and secured gold at the Commonwealth Youth Games in 2011, making her \"the one to watch\". But she went from the highs of being on international podiums to being berated for her size.Regular public weigh-ins and a restricted eating regime became an obsession she struggled to control and she suffered with bulimia and a binge eating disorder for five years.\"I was so lonely and very, very sad - I couldn\\'t tell anyone what was happening and I just felt completely worthless,\" she said. \"There was no way I could show any weakness so I just hid it.\"Phoebe fell in love with swimming while at City of Newcastle Swimming Club, which has since been disbanded. At 16 she moved 400 miles from home to attend Plymouth College, which has a longstanding partnership with Plymouth Leander Swimming Club and describes itself as a \"world-leading school for performance sport\". At one session, she said she was pulled aside and a coach pointed at parts of her body and told her she had gained weight \"here, here and here\". \"I just thought, \\'well I\\'ve messed up now\\',\" said Phoebe, who was at the time training relentlessly for world trials. \"I had bulimia all week and I had no energy at all. You just really get absorbed in a food obsession.\"Support is available on the BBC Action LineAt intensive training centres run by British Swimming, Phoebe recalled children being in the pool for four hours, walking for two, and starving themselves before weigh-in days. She said when a chocolate cake was put on the dinner table one evening, the swimmers devoured it.A coach then told them it had been put there as a test - and they\\'d failed, Phoebe said. \"We just thought, \\'oh my god, we are horrendous people\\'. You\\'d be consumed with guilt - you felt that if you\\'d eaten a treat it had stopped you getting to where you wanted to be.\"Image source, Phoebe LenderyouImage caption, Phoebe said her swimming coach in Canada was the \"saving grace\" and helped her have a healthy attitude to foodPhoebe quit in her second year at Plymouth, her \"mentality ruined due to the constant disappointment\". She only began swimming again when she moved to Canada and found a supportive coach.\"He was amazing, he just wanted me to be happy,\" she said. \"The conversation around food was really positive, making sure you were well-fuelled and not tired.\"Plymouth College said it had no records of concerns or complaints into coaching practices, adding it took swimming \"extremely seriously\" and had every confidence in Plymouth Leander\\'s training.\\'I used to swim through tears\\'Other swimmers have told the BBC their coaches\\' \"obsession\" with calorie counting had left them with unhealthy relationships with food.Zara, who competed nationally with a club in the north of England, lost almost half a stone in three weeks while on a foreign trip with her coach because she was scared to eat in front of him.\"The focus was always on our weight,\" she said. \"We didn\\'t have a nutritionist or anything - it was just calorie counting all the time.\"When she shed almost 7.8lb (5kg) after a bout of flu, she said she was praised for the dramatic weight loss.\"A lot of swimmers had anorexic and binge-eating habits,\" she said. \"Some didn\\'t have periods for a year because they lost so much weight.\"She said they would be berated for swimming poorly which was often because they were exhausted from training 20 hours a week on a poor diet.\"I used to swim through tears,\" she said.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, One swimmer said she can no longer bear to put on her swimming costumeZara, who does not want to be identified for fear of repercussions, had been on the path to becoming a top British swimmer but left the sport because of the damage it caused her.\"When you are that young you don\\'t think there\\'s anything wrong with it. Then you start to get a voice at 17, 18, and you learn that these things aren\\'t right.\"Another swimmer told the BBC she thought her dreams had come true when she joined a renowned swimming club but ended up terrified of eating the \"wrong\" thing and feared her coach.Sophie, not her real name, was ordered to attend extra fat-burning sessions and would regularly have panic attacks about missing her 05:00 alarm.When she suffered broken ribs in a fall, she trained in agony because she was too scared to tell her coach, then when she did she was told to go on an exercise bike instead to keep \"burning fat\".

There\\'s a bit of me that\\'s still upset today,\" she said.\"Even now, I try to put a swimming costume on and I can\\'t do it.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, A review is under way into how complaints were handled at Swim England in the wake of some high-profile investigationsFollowing the probe into Ellesmere Titans, which found swimmers had suffered eating disorders as a result of the club\\'s public weighing regime of children as young as 10, the sport\\'s governing body Swim England has said swimmers under 18 should not be weighed unless on a designated path to the Olympics or Commonwealth Games.Maria, who used to swim at Titans, said she had a \"complete breakdown\" because of the abuse she suffered at the club, where the investigation found swimmers were routinely shouted and sworn at.The experience meant the ex-swimmer, who is still involved in the sport and does not want to be identified, said she had learnt \"how not to work with children\".\"You would just never swear at a child if you thought they could do better.\"Image caption, Louise Graham, regional development manager for Swim England North East, said she had seen multiple examples of victim-shaming and bullyingMs Graham, who has researched coach development and led lectures on the subject at Staffordshire University, said it was vital the sport reviewed its methods to ensure it was not causing swimmers harm. \"Elite athletes are told \\'if you miss a session, you\\'re a failure - you have to sacrifice everything to be a success\\',\" she said. \"But this is an endurance sport andâ\\x80¦ teenagers who are swimming 16-plus hours a week are already making huge sacrifices.\"She added that performance \"doesn\\'t always have to be amazing - it\\'s got to be realistic to life\".\"You can\\'t have children getting up at 4.30 in the morning and getting negative comments immediately. It\\'s about building them up, not knocking them down.\"Elite swimming club to close after damning report\\'I dug up my swimming bullying trauma for nothing\\'Eating disorder hospital cases up 84%Swim England said it had a \"primary duty of care to safeguard the physical and emotional health of our members\". \"This is an issue we take extremely seriously as the welfare, health and wellbeing of athletes is paramount,\" it said. \"We recognise there will be instances where coaching behaviours fall short of expectations and we are committed to addressing these. \"We are reaching out to younger members, asking them for their direct feedback on a number of safeguarding and welfare issues, and bullying will be one of those topics they can directly comment on.\"Image source, Phoebe Lenderyou Image caption, Phoebe hopes swimmers will not be scared to speak out about bad practice in the sportThe organisation, which is undergoing a review into its complaints process following the closure of Ellesmere Titans, said it now had \"more robust\" processes in place and was due to publish a new safeguarding, welfare and culture action plan.Phoebe, now, 27, said she hoped swimmers would get more support in the future but feared even now she would be criticised for speaking out. \"This has been going on for years and we should be able to talk about it.

The jury could not reach verdicts on allegations by Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the wife of California Governor Gavin Newsom, and a woman known as Jane Doe 2. A mistrial was declared on those counts.He was also acquitted of sexual battery against an accuser known as Jane Doe 3. The Shakespeare in Love and Pulp Fiction producer and co-founder of the entertainment company Miramax was wearing a grey suit and looked pale at the court in Los Angeles on Monday. He was not using a wheelchair as he had done at previous court appearances.When he heard guilty on count one, the former Hollywood producer looked down. Then the court clerk read guilty on count two and he looked at his lawyer. At one point he stared at the jury.Timeline: How the Weinstein scandal unfoldedWATCH: \\'I was Harvey Weinstein\\'s spy\\'How Weinstein faced his reckoning The trial heard from dozens of witnesses in more than four weeks of often emotional testimony.But Monday\\'s verdict focused on allegations by four women stemming from 2005-13. The jury of eight men and four women spent nine days deliberating on three charges of rape and four other sexual assault counts.The woman whom Weinstein was convicted on Monday of raping, Jane Doe 1, was a Russian-born model.The trial\\'s first witness, she testified that she was in Los Angeles for an Italian film festival in February 2013 when the producer arrived uninvited at her Beverly Hills hotel room and raped her.She said after the verdict: \"Harvey Weinstein forever destroyed a part of me that night in 2013 and I will never get that back. \"The criminal trial was brutal and Weinstein\\'s lawyers put me through hell on the witness stand, but I knew I had to see this through to the end, and I did. \"I hope Weinstein never sees the outside of a prison cell during his lifetime.\"Ms Siebel Newsom gave emotional testimony that she was a documentary filmmaker when she was raped by Weinstein in a hotel room in 2005.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, WATCH: I was hired by Weinstein to extract information on celebritiesCalifornia\\'s first lady said in a statement on Monday after the verdict: \"Throughout the trial, Weinstein\\'s lawyers used sexism, misogyny, and bullying tactics to intimidate, demean, and ridicule us survivors. \"The trial was a stark reminder that we as a society have work to do.\"The only other of the four main accusers to publicly identify herself was Lauren Young.She said she was a model and aspiring actress and screenwriter when she met Weinstein about a script in 2013.Ms Young said he had trapped her in a hotel bathroom and sexually assaulted her.The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the charges involving her.A massage therapist, Jane Doe 3, testified that Weinstein had trapped and sexually assaulted her in a hotel bathroom in 2010. He was cleared of that attack.His conviction in New York in 2020 was a landmark moment for the #MeToo movement, which had been calling out widespread sexual abuse and harassment in the film industry for several years.Weinstein is currently appealing against the New York conviction.More than 80 women have come forward with accusations of sexual assault and misconduct against Weinstein spanning several decades.

It was launched in collaboration with nine South Korea-based cultural institutions.Image source, Google Arts & CultureImage caption, The Hantan River flows through South Korea's Gangwon and Gyeonggi provincesImage source, Google Arts & CultureImage caption, Yongneup, a high moor in the DMZ border area, is a paradise for wetland plantsFree travel between the two Koreas became impossible after the military demarcation line was drawn on 27 July 1953. The DMZ crosses the middle of the Korean Peninsula, spanning a total width of 4km (2.4mi), and is about 2km (1.2mi) each from the north and the south. At 907sq km (305sq mi), the DMZ is about 1.5 times the size of Seoul and almost twice the size of New York City. Places located beyond the civilian control line are not open to individual tourists, but can be visited with approved tour agencies. South Korea has also opened hiking trails in the area.

In particular, 38% of the endangered species of the Korean peninsula live in the zone. These include golden eagles, musk deer, and mountain goats, among others. Snapshots captured by unmanned cameras offer some hope for the future of these species.Image source, Google Arts & Culture/DMZ Botanic GardenImage caption, Wilford swertia, a herb with violet flowersFor years, researchers at the DMZ Botanic Garden have been conducting surveys along the barbed-wire fencing along the zone.

We can confirm that we are updating the pricing of our plans in certain countries,\" a Netflix spokesperson said.The firm\\'s shares closed 3.4% lower in New York on Thursday after the Wall Street Journal first reported the story.Netflix extends crackdown on password sharingVideo streaming subscriptions fall by two millionNetflix, which operates in more than 190 countries, has faced increased competition from streaming rivals including Amazon, HBO and Disney.Last year, the firm cut hundreds of jobs and launched a less expensive streaming option with adverts as it fought to grow its share of the increasingly competitive streaming market.In January, Netflix co-chief executive Greg Peters outlined how he planned to attract more subscribers.\"We want to make that spectrum even wider as we seek to serve more members around the world and trying to deliver appropriate value at those different price points,\" Mr Peters said.The company is also cracking down on people sharing their subscriptions.Netflix introduced limits on password sharing in more countries earlier this month. These require customers to pay an extra fee if they want friends and family who don\\'t live with them to share their subscription.Last summer, Netflix revealed that it had lost almost a million subscribers between April and the end of June as more people decided to quit the service.However, in January the company said subscriber numbers had jumped at the end of 2022.You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Harry and Meghan\\'s unseen video moments - the BBC\\'s Jonny Dymond takes a look.Related TopicsCompaniesStreamingNetflixMore on this storyNetflix extends crackdown on password sharing9 FebruaryVideo streaming subscriptions fall by two million30 JanuaryNetflix boss steps down as subscriber numbers rise20 JanuaryCathedral to close for The Crown filming20 JanuaryNetflix offers $385,000 for private jet attendant18 JanuaryTop StoriesLive.ÂPoland delivers first Leopard tanks to Ukraine on invasion anniversaryPublished11 hours agoWhy China launched a charm offensive over UkrainePublished6 hours agoIndia abstains from UN vote on Ukraine warPublished11 hours agoFeaturesLoss, bravery, resolve - a year witnessing warHow Putin\\'s fate is tied to his war in UkraineTwo friends changed by a year of warFighting to stay Ukrainian in a frontline mining townWATCH: One year of war in Ukraine in 87 seconds.

migrants who are legally in TunisiaImage caption: President Kais Saied has assured sub-Sahara African migrants who are legally in TunisiaTunisian President Kais Saied has called on sub-Saharan African people legally in the country to be “reassured” they would not be harmed over his stance against migrants.He however maintained that illegal migration was causing “demographic” changes in the country, saying those who were there illegally would not be allowed to stay.The president spoke during a meeting with the interior minister about the security situation in the country.On Tuesday, Mr Saied had ordered security agencies to crack down on illegal migration from sub-Saharan African countries. His reported remarks that illegal migration was interfering with the demographic make-up of the country was criticised by human rights groups in the country as racist.The Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights (FTDES) was quoted on Wednesday as referring to Mr Saied’s remarks as \"drowning in racism and hatred\".But Mr Saied on Thursday denied it, saying that those accusing him of racism were seeking to create discord and damage relations with other countries.Tunisia is a key transit point for migrants seeking to move to Europe crossing through the Mediterranean sea.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 17:39 23 Feb17:39 23 FebWhen can you be stripped of your British citizenship?Shamima Begum lost her appeal against the government\\'s decision to remove her British citizenship.Read morenextArticle share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 17:23 23 Feb17:23 23 FebGaza-Israel violence follows West Bank bloodshedBy David GrittenBBC NewsRocket-fire draws air strikes in the wake of a deadly Israeli military raid in Nablus on Wednesday.Read morenextArticle share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 15:10 23 Feb15:10 23 FebLebanon central bank chief faces corruption chargesRiad Salameh denies accusations of money laundering, embezzlement and illicit enrichment.Read morenextArticle share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 15:06 23 Feb15:06 23 FebNo interview needed for 12,000 asylum seekersBy Mark EastonHome editorThe Home Office is to scrap face-to-face interviews for asylum seekers from five countries.Read morenextArticle share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at 5:08 23 Feb5:08 23 FebTunisia arrests more critics of the presidentBBC World ServiceGetty ImagesCopyright: Getty ImagesMore prominent figures who are critics of President Kais Saied have been arrestedImage caption: More prominent figures who are critics of President Kais Saied have been arrestedTunisian police have arrested Chaima Issa, a prominent opponent to President Kais Saied and a senior official in the National Salvation Front.

President Kais Saied has called for “emergency measures” to be taken against large numbers of irregular migrants from sub-Saharan Africa.Mr Saied is quoted as saying that the influx of migrants was aimed at changing the country’s demographic make-up, in remarks criticised by rights groups as racist.\"The undeclared goal of the successive waves of illegal immigration is to consider Tunisia a purely African country that has no affiliation to the Arab and Islamic nations,\" the Reuters news agency quotes him as saying.The president spoke at a meeting with the country’s national security council on Tuesday.A spokesperson for the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights termed Mr Saied\\'s remarks \"a racist approach just like the campaigns in Europe... the presidential campaign aims to create an imaginary enemy for Tunisians to distract them from their basic problems\".Tunisia is a key transit point for migrants and refugees seeking to move to Europe.This month, dozens of migrants have been detained by Tunisian authorities in a crackdown.Article share toolsFacebookTwitterShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkRead more about these links.Posted at
