The environmental group had argued that the $1bn (£821m) funding in the form of loans and guarantees would contravene the UK's climate change commitments under the Paris accords.Friends of the Earth said the judgement was extremely disappointing.

Karim Madonga nicknamed mtu kazi (translated in street Kiswahili as \"a fighter\") has a huge following in East Africa and is known for his over the top boasts of his boxing ability.In his last fight he described his punch as a \"heat-seeking missile\". Now before Saturday's bout, he compared his punch to a \"Ukrainian missile\".The 43-year-old has won three fights, lost three and drawn one.

A number of other cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa, were also hit.Much of Ukraine is now under an emergency blackout after missiles hit power infrastructure in several cities. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the Challengers, the British army's main battle tank, would help Kyiv's forces \"push Russian troops back\".Russia responded by saying that providing more weapons to Ukraine would lead to intensified Russian operations and more civilian casualties.Later on Saturday - a day when Ukrainians celebrate the Old (or Orthodox) New Year - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian attacks on civilian targets could be stopped only if Ukraine's Western partners supplied necessary weapons.\"What is needed for this? Those weapons which are in the depots of our partners and which our soldiers are waiting for so much,\" he said in his nightly video address, adding that his forces shot down more than 20 out of 30 Russian missiles fired at Ukraine. The devastating strike in Dnipro hit the entrance of a nine-storey building, turning several floors into smouldering rubble, and leaving 73 injured, including 14 children, Ukrainian officials said, in what is likely to be the worst attack in months.A sizeable crowd gathered to watch the rescue effort at the site of the strike, while others joined rescue workers in a desperate search for survivors. There were urgent calls, human chains of volunteers clearing rubble and torch beams piercing thick clouds of dust and smoke.  In his address, Mr Zelensky said debris clearance in Dnipro would continue all night: \"We are fighting for every person, every life.\" So far, 38 people have been rescued from the building, including six children, officials say.There is no information yet on why the apartment block was the object of such devastation, as it is some distance from the nearest power facility. On a day when Russia seemed intent, once again, on targeting Ukraine's energy grid, this could have been one of the less accurate missiles in Russia's arsenal, or something brought down by Ukraine's air defences - although on the face of it, this seems a less likely explanation. It has been two weeks since the last wave of Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid. Mr Zelensky said of the energy infrastructure facilities hit on Saturday that the most difficult situation was in the Kharkiv and Kyiv regions.Ukrainian state energy company Ukrenergo earlier said round-the-clock consumption limits had been set for all regions until midnight local time.Officials, in the West and in Ukraine, had begun to wonder if Russia's \"energy war\" might be coming to an end, due to a possible shortage of suitable missiles and the evident fact the strategy has yet to break Ukraine's spirit.

      " the p tags is: The UK is to send Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine to bolster the country's war effort, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said.He spoke to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in a call on Saturday, during which he confirmed he would send the equipment and additional artillery systems, No 10 said. Downing Street said the move shows \"the UK's ambition to intensify support.\"The government is to issue 14 tanks to Ukraine.Around 30 AS90s, which are large, self-propelled guns, are also expected to be delivered. President Zelensky has thanked the UK, saying that the decision to send the tanks \"will not only strengthen us on the battlefield, but also send the right signal to other partners\".He said the UK's support was \"always strong\" and was \"now impenetrable\". No 10 said that during the call, Mr Sunak and Mr Zelensky also discussed also recent Ukrainian victories, as well as the \"need to seize on this moment with an acceleration of global military and diplomatic support\".At least 14 people were killed in a strike on an apartment block in the eastern city of Dnipro.Mr Sunak said the Challengers, the British Army's main battle tank, would help Kyiv's forces \"push Russian troops back\".  Built in the late 1990s, the Challenger tank is more than 20 years old, but it will be the most modern tank at Ukraine's disposal.

      " the title tag is: UK to send Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine, Rishi Sunak confirms - BBC News\n",
      "The UK is to send Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine to bolster the country's war effort, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said.He spoke to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in a call on Saturday, during which he confirmed he would send the equipment and additional artillery systems, No 10 said. Downing Street said the move shows \"the UK's ambition to intensify support.\"The government is to issue 14 tanks to Ukraine.Around 30 AS90s, which are large, self-propelled guns, are also expected to be delivered. President Zelensky has thanked the UK, saying that the decision to send the tanks \"will not only strengthen us on the battlefield, but also send the right signal to other partners\".He said the UK's support was \"always strong\" and was \"now impenetrable\". No 10 said that during the call, Mr Sunak and Mr Zelensky also discussed also recent Ukrainian victories, as well as the \"need to seize on this moment with an acceleration of global military and diplomatic support\".At least 14 people were killed in a strike on an apartment block in the eastern city of Dnipro.Mr Sunak said the Challengers, the British Army's main battle tank, would help Kyiv's forces \"push Russian troops back\".  Built in the late 1990s, the Challenger tank is more than 20 years old, but it will be the most modern tank at Ukraine's disposal. The tanks will provide Ukraine with better protection, and more accurate firepower. The UK will begin training the Ukrainian Armed Forces to use the tanks and guns in the coming days.While the donation alone is not considered a game-changer, it is hoped that the UK's move will inspire other countries to donate more modern equipment to help Ukraine.

The town is relatively small, with a pre-war population of just 10,000, and its strategic significance is debatable. But if it is confirmed that Russian forces have seized control of it, then there will likely be a big sigh of relief in the Kremlin.Barely any walls in Soledar remain standing, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said this week. Describing almost apocalyptic scenes, he spoke of the nearby terrain as scarred by missile strikes and littered with Russian corpses.Speaking during his nightly address from Kyiv on Friday, Mr Zelensky said the battle in the region continued to rage, but avoided any reference to Russia's claims of control over Soledar. \"Although the enemy has concentrated its greatest forces in this direction, our troops - the Armed Forces of Ukraine, all defence and security forces - are defending the state,\" the Ukrainian leader said. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, compared the fight for Soledar and Bakhmut to one of the bitterest battles of World War One, at Verdun.Regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Thursday that 559 civilians including 15 children remained in Soledar and could not be moved out. The town's significance for the Russian military is disputed by military analysts because of its relatively small size. The US-based think tank Institute for the Study of War said while it was likely that Russian forces had captured Soledar, it did not believe they would then be able to go on to encircle Bakhmut.Nevertheless, if it becomes clear that Russia has taken it, then that will be seen in Moscow as progress - even a victory. That is exactly what President Vladimir Putin needs as Russia has failed to capture a single town in Ukraine since July 2022. Since then, Moscow's forces have suffered a whole series of embarrassing defeats. Ukraine's successful counter-attack pushed Russia almost completely out of Kharkiv region in the north-east. In October, Russia's Kerch bridge came under attack, with Russian forces retreating from the city of Kherson the following month. The southern port city had been the only regional capital that Russia had managed to seize since the invasion began. Capturing Soledar would be something for Moscow to present as some \"good news\" to the Russian people and the troops on the wintry front line.But Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesperson for Ukraine's eastern military command, denied Soledar was in Russian hands: \"We won't give any more details as we do not want to reveal the tactical positions of our fighters.\"Deputy Defence Minister, Hanna Malyar, said fighting had been \"hot in Soledar overnight\". Ukrainian fighters were \"bravely trying to hold the defence\", she added, in what was a difficult stage of the war.Western and Ukrainian officials have said much of the fighting in Soledar and Bakhmut is being done by the notoriously brutal Wagner mercenary group. Its leader, 61-year-old Yevgeny Prigozhin, has claimed repeatedly over the past few days that his forces are the only units on the ground in Soledar. He said on Tuesday night that his mercenaries had seized the town, only to be contradicted by Russia's defence ministry the next morning. Daily updates from the Russian defence ministry have made no mention whatsoever of Wagner, and Friday's briefing was no exception. The military said that paratroopers had played a key part in the capture of the town. Mr Prigozhin then released a statement saying he was \"surprised\" to read the defence ministry briefing. There \"wasn't a single paratrooper\" in Soledar, he insisted, warning against \"insulting [his] fighters\" and \"stealing others' achievements\".And on Friday evening, Mr Prigozhin accused \"officials who want to stay in their places\" of being the biggest threat to his group's advance in Ukraine. In a later statement, the defence ministry praised the mercenaries' \"courageous and selfless actions\" during the fighting, but again emphasised the leading role of regular Russian forces. Analysts have long spoken of tensions between the military and Mr Prigozhin's Wagner group. The Russian oligarch has publicly criticised senior military leaders, including Gen Valery Gerasimov, appointed two days ago as overall commander of Russian forces in Ukraine. While Russia has mobilised some 300,000 reservists for the war since the end of September, Prigozhin has looked to recruit extra numbers from Russia's prisons. Andriy Yermak told French daily Le Monde that Russian criminals had been sent straight to their deaths on the front line: \"Soledar is a scene of street battles, with neither side really in control of the town.\"Ukraine battle hints at rift in pro-Russian forcesSatellite images show Soledar devastationRussia-supporting Wagner mercenary numbers soarNepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare \n",

Meladze said later that all he wished for was for the conflict to stop.Mr Volodin has played an important role in the Putin presidency and was considered the brains behind his election campaign in 2011.In his post on the social messaging site Telegram, the speaker of the lower house of parliament said it was clear that existing measures to counter insulting remarks were insufficient, and should be treated as calls for extremism.Such \"scoundrels\" were living comfortably thanks to their country, he said, leasing their property and receiving rent and royalties at the expense of fellow citizens, while at the same time being able to \"publicly drag Russia through the mud\".His proposal to confiscate property was backed by a senior Russian senator, Andrei Klishas, who heads the upper house of parliament's committee on constitutional legislation.Mr Klishas said last month that Russians who had moved abroad and worked remotely for domestic companies should be made to feel less comfortable.This video can not be playedWatch Russian police make arrests after crowds of anti-war protesters gather in Russian cities (February 2022)Ukraine defence minister: We are in effect part of NatoKremlin critic jailed for 'fake news' on Russia warNepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare \n",

Meladze said later that all he wished for was for the conflict to stop.Mr Volodin has played an important role in the Putin presidency and was considered the brains behind his election campaign in 2011.In his post on the social messaging site Telegram, the speaker of the lower house of parliament said it was clear that existing measures to counter insulting remarks were insufficient, and should be treated as calls for extremism.Such \"scoundrels\" were living comfortably thanks to their country, he said, leasing their property and receiving rent and royalties at the expense of fellow citizens, while at the same time being able to \"publicly drag Russia through the mud\".His proposal to confiscate property was backed by a senior Russian senator, Andrei Klishas, who heads the upper house of parliament's committee on constitutional legislation.Mr Klishas said last month that Russians who had moved abroad and worked remotely for domestic companies should be made to feel less comfortable.This video can not be playedWatch Russian police make arrests after crowds of anti-war protesters gather in Russian cities (February 2022)Ukraine defence minister: We are in effect part of NatoKremlin critic jailed for 'fake news' on Russia warNepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare\n",

      " the p tags is: Ukraine has become a de facto member of the Nato alliance, the Ukrainian defence minister says, as Western countries, once concerned that military assistance could be seen as an escalation by Russia, change their \"thinking approach\".In an interview with the BBC, Oleksii Reznikov said he was sure Ukraine would receive long-sought weapons, including tanks and fighter jets, as both Ukraine and Russia seemed to be preparing for new offensives in the spring.\"This concern about the next level of escalation, for me, is some kind of protocol,\" Mr Reznikov said. \"Ukraine as a country, and the armed forces of Ukraine, became [a] member of Nato. De facto, not de jure (by law). Because we have weaponry, and the understanding of how to use it.\"Russian President Vladimir Putin has framed his invasion of Ukraine as an existential battle against Western countries that want to weaken Russia. Russian figures have argued they are fighting Nato in Ukraine, as the West has supplied the country with weapons in what they call a war of aggression.Ukraine, for years, has sought to join the military alliance between the US, Canada and 28 European countries, something President Vladimir Putin has described as a security threat for Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pushed for fast-track accession, but it is unclear whether full membership is something the alliance members will seriously consider even after the war is over, despite pledges of support. Article 5 of the Nato Treaty says an armed attack against any member should be considered an attack against all.Mr Reznikov, however, denied that his comments would be seen as controversial, not only by Russia but, perhaps, by Nato itself, as the alliance has taken steps not to be seen as a party to the conflict. \"Why [would it be] controversial? It's true. It's a fact,\" Mr Reznikov said. \"I'm sure that in the near future, we'll become member of Nato, de jure.\"The defence minister spoke in the capital, Kyiv, as Ukrainian and Russian forces continued to fight for the small town of Soledar, in the eastern Donetsk region, in some of the most intense battles in the nearly 11-month-old war. The Russian offensive is led by the mercenary Wagner Group, whose founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, a long-time Putin ally, has become a vocal critic of the Russian army's performance in Ukraine.On Tuesday, Mr Prigozhin claimed that his fighters had seized control of the town, an allegation that was dismissed by Ukraine and, remarkably, by the Kremlin, in what was considered a rebuff to Mr Prigozhin. The situation in Soledar was \"very difficult\", Mr Reznikov said, but \"under control\". He said Wagner fighters were being used in \"wave after wave after wave\" of attacks, leading to a high number of deaths, and that Mr Prigozhin was interested in the possible economic benefits of seizing the town, home to Europe's largest salt mines. \"They'll earn money from blood,\" he said.Soledar is about 10km (six miles) from Bakhmut, a strategic city where Ukrainian and Russian forces have been engaged in a months-long war of attrition that has caused widespread destruction and heavy losses on both sides. There, Wagner mercenaries have also been deployed in large numbers, and Mr Prigozhin is believed to have made the capture of Bakhmut a personal goal.The group, Mr Reznikov said, \"need to deliver some kind of proof to declare they're better than the regular armed forces of the Russian Federation\". If seized, Bakhmut could pave the way for a Russian push towards Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, two Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk, a region that has been a key target for President Putin. Mr Reznikov was speaking before Russia on Friday claimed it had taken control of Soledar. Ukraine disputed this and accused Russia of \"information noise\".Any gains would be, more than anything else, of extreme symbolic value for Russia. They would come after a series of humiliating setbacks, including a chaotic retreat from the north-eastern region of Kharkiv and the withdrawal from the southern city of Kherson, the only regional capital Russian forces had captured in the war.Mr Reznikov claimed that \"approximately 500 or 600\" Russian fighters were being killed every day across the country, while Ukraine was losing a tenth of that, figures that could not be independently verified. He believed Russia could be trying to gather \"forces, ammunition and weapons\" for an offensive from areas it already occupies in the south and east. Ukraine, in the meantime, needed time to regroup and rearm while it waited for the delivery of Western weapons. \"Spring is the best period to refresh the movement for all sides,\" he said. \"We understand they'll be ready to start and, surely, we have to be ready to start.\"However, he did not repeat a claim that Russia could be preparing another invasion from Belarus, a warning that has been dismissed by the head of the Ukrainian military intelligence agency. The movement from the north, Mr Reznikov said, \"would take a lot of time and they [Russia] have no resources\".Mr Reznikov spoke a day after the Russian defence ministry replaced the commander of its forces in Ukraine, a surprise announcement that was seen as a sign of a power struggle. Gen Valery Gerasimov, one of the architects of last year's invasion, would return to the post that was being held by Gen Sergei Surovikin, who had been appointed in October.The change, Mr Reznikov said, was a result of the \"conflict between Mr Prigozhin and the armed forces of the Russian Federation\". Gen Surovikin oversaw the recent brutal attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure that, according to Mr Reznikov, \"reduced the [Russian missile] stocks without any results\", repeating a Ukrainian claim that \"they're running out of missiles\".As Poland and Britain revealed plans to deliver battle tanks for the first time, Mr Reznikov said he was sure Ukraine would receive \"tanks, fighting aircrafts or jets, and long-range weaponry to hit targets in 300km (186 miles) as well\", because \"things were changing\" in Western countries.He dismissed concerns that the announcements could trigger a Russian response, despite now-familiar threats from Moscow. \"I have a war in my country,\" he said. \"They're hitting my cities, my hospital, my kindergartens, my schools.

      " the p tags is: President Vladimir Putin has removed Russia's top commander in Ukraine, just three months after he was installed. Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov will now lead what Mr Putin terms a \"special military operation\". Gen Gerasimov replaces Sergei Surovikin who has overseen recent brutal attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.The reshuffle comes as Russians claim they are making progress in eastern Ukraine after suffering a series of military defeats in recent months. Russia launched its invasion into Ukraine on 24 February. Gen Gerasimov, who has been in post since 2012, is the longest-serving Russian chief of general staff of the post-Soviet era.Gen Surovikin - now his deputy - has been dubbed \"General Armageddon\" for his brutal tactics in previous wars, including Russia's operations in Syria and the heavy bombardment of the city of Aleppo in particular.Shortly after he was appointed to lead the operation in October, Russia began its campaign to destroy Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leaving millions of Ukrainian civilians without power or running water for extended periods in the depths of winter. He also oversaw Russia's withdrawal from the southern city of Kherson - a major success for the Ukrainians. Russia's defence ministry said the decision to replace Gen Surovikin was aimed at organising \"closer contact between different branches of the armed forces and improving the quality and effectiveness of the management of Russian forces\".But the move has been seen by some as a sign that he may have gained too much power. Some of Russia's hawkish military bloggers, who support the war but frequently criticise the way it is being carried out, have been highly critical of Russia's military leadership, including the new head of the special operation, Gen Gerasimov.Wednesday's announcement comes as fighting continues in Soledar.The fall of Soledar may help Russian troops in their assault on the strategic city of Bakhmut, about 10km (six miles) to the south-west, providing them with a secure artillery position within range of the city.  Soledar also has deep salt mines, which could be used to station troops and store equipment, protected from Ukrainian missiles.Russia's mercenary Wagner Group has taken full credit for \"storming\" it. On Tuesday night, the group's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his forces were in full control of Soledar. However, on Wednesday the Russian defence ministry released a statement appearing to contradict his claim - or that only Wagner group troops were involved. This led to Mr Prigozhin repeating the claim on Wednesday evening. In a short statement on Telegram, he boasted that his mercenaries had killed around 500 pro-Ukraine troops. \"The whole city is littered with the corpses of Ukrainian soldiers,\" he wrote. Ukraine has recently made similar comments about piles of Russian bodies.

      " the title tag is: Ukraine war: Sergei Surovikin removed as commander of Ukraine invasion force - BBC News\n",
      "President Vladimir Putin has removed Russia's top commander in Ukraine, just three months after he was installed. Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov will now lead what Mr Putin terms a \"special military operation\". Gen Gerasimov replaces Sergei Surovikin who has overseen recent brutal attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.The reshuffle comes as Russians claim they are making progress in eastern Ukraine after suffering a series of military defeats in recent months. Russia launched its invasion into Ukraine on 24 February. Gen Gerasimov, who has been in post since 2012, is the longest-serving Russian chief of general staff of the post-Soviet era.Gen Surovikin - now his deputy - has been dubbed \"General Armageddon\" for his brutal tactics in previous wars, including Russia's operations in Syria and the heavy bombardment of the city of Aleppo in particular.Shortly after he was appointed to lead the operation in October, Russia began its campaign to destroy Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leaving millions of Ukrainian civilians without power or running water for extended periods in the depths of winter. He also oversaw Russia's withdrawal from the southern city of Kherson - a major success for the Ukrainians. Russia's defence ministry said the decision to replace Gen Surovikin was aimed at organising \"closer contact between different branches of the armed forces and improving the quality and effectiveness of the management of Russian forces\".But the move has been seen by some as a sign that he may have gained too much power. Some of Russia's hawkish military bloggers, who support the war but frequently criticise the way it is being carried out, have been highly critical of Russia's military leadership, including the new head of the special operation, Gen Gerasimov.Wednesday's announcement comes as fighting continues in Soledar.The fall of Soledar may help Russian troops in their assault on the strategic city of Bakhmut, about 10km (six miles) to the south-west, providing them with a secure artillery position within range of the city.  Soledar also has deep salt mines, which could be used to station troops and store equipment, protected from Ukrainian missiles.Russia's mercenary Wagner Group has taken full credit for \"storming\" it. On Tuesday night, the group's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his forces were in full control of Soledar. However, on Wednesday the Russian defence ministry released a statement appearing to contradict his claim - or that only Wagner group troops were involved. This led to Mr Prigozhin repeating the claim on Wednesday evening. In a short statement on Telegram, he boasted that his mercenaries had killed around 500 pro-Ukraine troops. \"The whole city is littered with the corpses of Ukrainian soldiers,\" he wrote. Ukraine has recently made similar comments about piles of Russian bodies. There is no independent confirmation.The US-based Maxar Technologies company has published pictures of Soledar from August and early January, showing the scale of destruction during the recent fighting.The apparent differences in Russia's official narrative surrounding the latest events around Soledar hint at divisions in the country's military leadership, particularly between the Wagner Group and the defence ministry.

We asked several military analysts how they think events on the ground will unfold in 2023.Could it conclude in the coming year and how - on the battlefield or at the negotiating table? Or might it grind on to 2024?Michael Clarke, associate director of the Strategic Studies Institute, Exeter, UKThose who seek to invade another country anywhere across the great Eurasian steppes are condemned eventually to winter in it. Napoleon, Hitler and Stalin all had to keep their armies moving in the face of a steppes winter, and now - his invasion going backwards on the ground - Vladimir Putin is digging his forces in for the winter to await a new Russian offensive in the spring.Both sides need a pause but the Ukrainians are better equipped and motivated to keep going, and we can expect them to maintain the pressure, at least in the Donbas. Around Kreminna and Svatove they are very close to a big breakthrough that would throw Russian forces 40 miles back to the next natural defensive line, close to where their invasion effectively began in February. Kyiv will be reluctant to halt when the immediate prize is so great. Ukrainian offensives might, nevertheless, pause down in the south-west, following the recovery of Kherson. Crossing over to the east side of the Dnipro river to pressure Russia's vulnerable road and rail links into Crimea might be too demanding. But the possibility of Kyiv launching a surprise new offensive can never be ruled out. For 2023, the key determinant will be the fate of Russia's spring offensive. Putin had admitted that about 50,000 of the newly mobilised troops are already at the front; the other 250,000 of those just mobilised are training for next year. There is no scope for anything but more war until the fortunes of those new Russian forces are settled on the battlefield. A short and unstable ceasefire is the only other prospect. Putin has made it clear he will not stop. And Ukraine has made it clear it is still fighting for its life. Andrei Piontkovsky, scientist and analyst based in Washington DCUkraine will win by restoring completely its territorial integrity by spring 2023 at the latest. Two factors are shaping this conclusion. One is the motivation, determination and courage of the Ukrainian military and Ukrainian nation as a whole, which is unprecedented in modern war history.The other is the fact that, after years of appeasement of a Russian dictator, the West has finally grown up to realise the magnitude of historical challenge it  faces. This is best illustrated by a recent statement by Nato General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg.\"The price we pay is in money. While the price the Ukrainians pay is in blood. If authoritarian regimes see that force is rewarded we will all pay a much higher price. And the world will become a more dangerous world for all of us.\"The exact timing of the inevitable Ukrainian victory will be determined by the speed at which Nato can deliver a new game-changing package of military assault weapons (tanks, planes, long-ranged missiles). I expect Melitopol will become the key battle point in the coming months (maybe weeks). Having taken over Melitopol, Ukrainians will easily move to the Azov Sea, effectively cutting off supply and communication lines to Crimea.Russian capitulation will be formally agreed upon at technical talks after devastating Ukrainian advances on the battleground.  The victorious powers  - Ukraine, UK, USA - will shape a new international security architecture. Barbara Zanchetta, Department of War Studies, King's College LondonVladimir Putin expected Ukraine's passive acceptance of its more powerful neighbour's actions, with no meaningful involvement of other countries. This grave miscalculation has led to a protracted conflict, with seemingly no end in sight.The winter will be difficult, as Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure will try to break the morale and endurance of an already shattered population. But Ukrainian resilience has proved to be remarkable. They will stand firm. The war will drag on. And on.The prospects for negotiation are bleak. For a potential peace deal the core demands of at least one side need to change. There is no evidence that this has happened, or that it will happen soon.How will the end come, then?The costs of the war, both material and human, might break the level of commitment of the Russian political elite. The key will be inside Russia.Past wars in which miscalculation was a crucial element, such as Vietnam for United States, or Afghanistan for the Soviet Union, only ended in this way. Domestic political conditions shifted in the country that had miscalculated, making exit - either \"honourable\" or not - the only viable option.This may only happen, however, if the West stands firm in its support for Ukraine, in the face of increased domestic pressures linked to the costs of the war.Sadly, this will continue to be a long-protracted political, economic and military battle of resolve. And by the end of 2023 it will most probably still be ongoing.Ben Hodges, former commanding general, United States Army EuropeIt's too early to plan a victory parade in Kyiv but all the momentum is with Ukraine now and there is no doubt in my mind that they will win this war, probably in 2023.  Things will move slower over the winter but there's no doubt that Ukraine's forces will be better able to cope than Russia's because of all the winter equipment coming from the UK, Canada and Germany.By January, Ukraine could be in a position to begin the final phase of the campaign which is the liberation of Crimea.We know from history that war is a test of will and a test of logistics. When I see the determination of the Ukrainian people and soldiers, and the rapidly improving logistical situation for Ukraine, I see no other outcome but a Russian defeat.The Russian pull-out from Kherson has partly led me to this conclusion. Firstly as a psychological boost for the Ukrainian people, secondly as a profound embarrassment for the Kremlin and thirdly by handing Ukraine's forces a key operational advantage - all approaches into Crimea are now within range of Ukrainian weapon systems.I believe that the end of 2023 will see Crimea fully restored to Ukrainian control and sovereignty though there may be some sort or agreement that allows Russia to phase out some of its naval presence in Sevastopolâ¦ perhaps even to the end of the treaty (approximately 2025) that had existed before Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea.  Reconstruction efforts will be under way on the Ukrainian infrastructure along the Azov Sea coast, including the important ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk, and the reopening of the North Crimean Canal that diverts water from the Dnipro to Crimea will be another important project receiving attention.David Gendelman, military expert based in IsraelInstead of \"how it's going to end\" here is what each side would like to achieve in the next phase.Only about half of Russia's 300,000 mobilised troops are already in the fighting zone. The rest, together with the forces freed for action after Kherson withdrawal, gives the Russians an opportunity to launch an offensive. The occupation of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions will continue but a major Russian breakthrough like a drive from the south to Pavlograd to encircle the Ukrainian forces in the Donbas is less likely.More probable is a continuation of current tactics - a slow grinding of Ukrainian forces on narrow directions and a slow advance, like in Bakhmut and Avdiivka areas, with possible same tactics in Svatove-Kreminna area. Continuing targeting of Ukrainian energy infrastructure and other attacks on Ukrainian rear will complete this war of attrition strategy.Significant Ukrainian forces were also freed after a Russian retreat from Kherson. For them the most strategically valuable direction is south, to Melitopol or Berdyansk, aiming to cut the Russian mainland corridor to Crimea. That would be a major Ukrainian victory, and that is exactly why Russians are fortifying Melitopol.Another option for Ukraine is Svatove - success there would endanger the whole northern flank of the entire Russian frontline. The big question is how many Ukrainian forces are free and available for the offensive at this point, and what timetable General Zaluzhnyi has on his desk stating how many new reserve brigades and corps that are being built will be ready in one, two or three months from now, including manpower, armoured vehicles and heavy weapons. After the mud freezes, we will get the answer to this question. And this answer will get us a little closer to \"how it's going to end\".The analysts were chosen for their military expertise and their mix of perspectives Nepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare \n",

Continuing targeting of Ukrainian energy infrastructure and other attacks on Ukrainian rear will complete this war of attrition strategy.Significant Ukrainian forces were also freed after a Russian retreat from Kherson. For them the most strategically valuable direction is south, to Melitopol or Berdyansk, aiming to cut the Russian mainland corridor to Crimea. That would be a major Ukrainian victory, and that is exactly why Russians are fortifying Melitopol.Another option for Ukraine is Svatove - success there would endanger the whole northern flank of the entire Russian frontline. The big question is how many Ukrainian forces are free and available for the offensive at this point, and what timetable General Zaluzhnyi has on his desk stating how many new reserve brigades and corps that are being built will be ready in one, two or three months from now, including manpower, armoured vehicles and heavy weapons. After the mud freezes, we will get the answer to this question.

That's something to ask Foreign Secretary James Cleverly when he is on our show this Sunday.While Mr Sunak has a ghastly set of problems to attend to at home, part of being an effective prime minister is wielding influence abroad. But, as one senior former minister laments, there's been little sign of a grand vision, with \"demoralisation left, right and centre\" instead.Like any leader, there are some things they have no choice but to do. When it comes to foreign policy, for Mr Sunak, there is the UK's commitment to Ukraine.Unlike Boris Johnson, he's hardly likely to have Ukrainian streets named after him. But his commitment is as solid as a rock, the right thing to do and politically a no-brainer. Despite the impact on our fuel bills, there's no sign of the public expecting anything but full-throated support for Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.And when it comes to the issue of people arriving in the UK in small boats, efforts are being put into repairing the relationship with France's President Emmanuel Macron.This was \"essentially broken with Boris\", according to one Whitehall source, and a better relationship with Paris could bring a resolution to that problem.There's also been a visible effort by the government to move towards a solution on the Northern Ireland protocol - the trickiest hangover from the Brexit deal minted by Mr Johnson.Long gone is the tough talk and sabre rattling, with one EU ambassador saying Mr Sunak's government has \"completely changed the mood\".One former diplomat warns there will be a \"showdown moment\" ahead of next year's 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement which brought peace to Northern Ireland.

Governments can't ignore China if they want to solve issues like climate change, but they cannot also cut themselves off from an evolving mega power. It is hard so far to see how Mr Sunak's government will manage these unavoidable problems differently.Yet this week we may see the foreign secretary fill in some of the blanks in Mr Sunak's foreign policy.On Monday, Mr Cleverly will make his pitch to focus on new friends - \"future partnerships\" around the world - essentially building better relationships with countries who are neither the global bad guys nor Britain's traditional allies.Mr Cleverly will argue for closer ties with countries like Indonesia, South Africa and Brazil whose influence is growing. The idea is to lengthen the UK's list of global friends - it's described as the \"really smart and obvious thing to do\". But one senior Conservative MP worries the government's foreign policy will be \"devoid of any meaningful depth but heavy on flirtation with cameras\", adding that it's time to spell out its objectives and \"show some grit when it comes to threats from autocratic states\".Mr Sunak said foreign policy would go through an \"evolutionary leap\". But when you look down the list of challenges it's hard to see, so far, anything that matches that grand language. It's not Theresa May's \"Global Britain\", David Cameron's \"golden era\" with China or Tony Blair's \"ethical foreign policy\" - much maligned though they all came to be.

We haven't seen troops like this before,\" the Ukrainian commander tells us.Commander Skala, as he wants to be called, is controlling the Ukrainian operation to defend the city of Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region from an underground chamber off a nondescript street. It is one of the main command centres the Ukrainian military has set up in the city, and few journalists have been here.A tall, hefty man with sparkling eyes, he watches a live feed from a drone hovering outside the eastern edge of the city on a big screen in the centre of the room.One of the battalion's units is trying to spot the location of Russian positions, to aid another unit which has just gone out to defend eastern approaches to Bakhmut under attack.In addition to Russian armed forces, mercenaries from the private paramilitary Wagner group have been sent in their thousands to front lines around Bakhmut. \"Wagner soldiers openly advance under fire towards us even if they're littering the land with their bodies, even if out of 60 people in their platoon only 20 are left. It's very difficult to hold against such an invasion. We weren't prepared for that, and we're learning now,\" Commander Skala says.\"Some weeks ago, we lost positions on the eastern approaches to the city because the enemy was constantly storming us with assaults. We moved to secondary front lines to save our soldiers,\" he adds.\"We are trying to work smartly and get those positions back. Sometimes you have to withdraw to attack the enemy properly.\"Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has said Ukrainians have turned every house in Bakhmut into a fortress, and that there were now \"500 lines of defence\".Russia has been using all its might to try to take Bakhmut - a battle considered critical for the country after it lost ground in Ukraine in recent months, being pushed out of Kherson in the south and the Kharkiv region in the north-east. Capturing Bakhmut is also important to further Russia's aim to control the whole of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.Throughout our conversation with Commander Skala, muffled explosions can be heard from above ground. The second you step outside, the sound is loud enough to make your heart pound - the terrifying whistle of shells flying in followed by the deafening boom of the impact. And the sound never stops as the bombs keep falling.One resident described it as \"the end of the world\" and there are moments when it feels like that. Bombs have ripped through the middle of apartment blocks, blown away the facades of buildings and created craters by the side of streets. It was hard to find a window in Bakhmut that was intact. The ground is littered with broken glass and debris. This was once a quiet, ordinary town in the east, known for its sparkling wine. Now, it's become a byword for war and Ukraine's resistance. It lies at a vital road intersection, but over the months, the battle here has gained a symbolic importance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently called it the \"fortress of our morale\".Bakhmut used to be home to just over 70,000 people before the war. Just a tenth of its residents - mostly elderly or poor - remain.While the streets are largely empty, we see dozens of civilians in an aid centre, known here as a \"resilience centre\".It has power, and wi-fi provided by Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system. Volunteers distribute small packets of food, medicines and other basic supplies. A wood-burner in the centre keeps the room warm. This is a lifeline for the people in Bakhmut. Many sit huddled around electrical points, trying to charge up their phones. What's remarkable is that even when shells land just a few hundred metres from the centre, people don't flinch. It's as if they've become numb, running from bombs every day. Trauma is visible on many faces though. Why don't you leave, we asked Anatolay Suschenko, who was standing in a queue for some food. \"I have nowhere to go. I'm alone. Who would want to take an 86-year-old?\" he said. \"Here, at least sometimes when soldiers throw away food or soup, I find it and eat it. And I get free bread.

In a location in the city we can't disclose because it could compromise his safety, we met Oleksiy Reva, who has been the mayor of Bakhmut for 33 years. \"It's those who don't have money and don't want to face the unknown who are staying. But we are talking to them about it. Because safety is most important, safety and peace,\" he said.Why does he continue to stay, we asked. \"This is my life, my job, my fate.

The unit of soldiers we meet try to spot Russian locations and fire artillery - Soviet-era D-30 guns - in their direction, to allow Ukrainian infantry to push ahead every day. But barely any advance is being made.\"The equipment is outdated. It works fine and does the job, but it can be better. We also have to be very economical with our shells, very precise with our targets so we don't run out of ammunition.

      " the p tags is: The deaths of dozens of Russian soldiers in a new year missile strike on a building in occupied eastern Ukraine have prompted recriminations among critics of the Russian military.Russia's defence ministry has so far conceded that 89 people were killed in the Ukrainian attack on Makiivka at around midnight on New Year's Eve.One commander's wife accused the West of trying to destroy Russia.But elsewhere military leaders were accused of incompetence.Ukraine says as many as 400 people were killed or wounded at Makiivka, and numbers into the hundreds have been given by Russian nationalists on social media. However, there is no way of verifying how many soldiers were killed when US-made Himars missiles hit a vocational college packed with conscripts. Ammunition was also being stored close to the site, which was reduced to rubble. Whatever the number, this is the highest number of deaths acknowledged by Russia since it invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022.Rallies were held in several cities in Russia's south-western region of Samara, where governor Dmitry Azarov said many of the conscripts had lived.The biggest commemoration took place in the city of Samara itself, with at least 200 people taking part. Other official events were held in the industrial city of Tolyatti and in Syzran and Novokuybyshevsk.No criticism was reported at the Samara rally, where the main remarks came from Yekaterina Kolotovkina, who said \"neither we nor our husbands wanted war; the entire West united against us to eliminate us and our children\". Hers was very much an official voice as her husband, Lt Gen Andrei Kolotovkin, commands the 2nd Guards Combined Arms Army based in Samara.The commander's wife's remarks prompted anger on social media with independent journalist Dmitry Kolezev pointing out that her husband did not die in Makiivka. \"Could we have at least some evidence?\" he asked, in response to her claim that the West intended to kill Samara's children. Another blogger condemned her comments as a \"pack of lies\".The governor of Samara met defence ministry officials in Moscow on Tuesday and was expected to visit some of the wounded in hospital in the city of Rostov-on-Don the next day.President Vladimir Putin has so far said nothing about the attack, but did sign a decree on Tuesday for families of National Guard soldiers killed in service to be paid 5m roubles (Â£57,000; $69,000).The soldiers sent to Makiivka were among an estimated 300,000 men signed up by Russia's military as part of the president's \"partial mobilisation\" announced last September in the face of a string of setbacks in Ukraine.A number of voices have been highly critical of the military in the aftermath of the attack on Makiivka, a city adjacent to the main city of Donetsk and some distance from the front line.Pavel Gubarev, a former leading official in Russia's proxy authority in Donetsk, condemned the decision to place a large number of soldiers in one building as \"criminal negligence\". Such mistakes were being made early in the war, he complained, and even if the conscripts did not realise the risk, the authorities should have. \"If no-one is punished for this, then it'll only get worse,\" he warned.One theory promoted by local security officials was that Ukrainian forces had been able to detect the use of Russian mobile phones by servicemen arriving at the vocational college on New Year's Eve.The deputy speaker of Moscow's local parliament, Andrei Medvedev, said it was predictable that the soldiers would be blamed - instead of the commander who made the original decision to position so many soldiers in one place.\"History will certainly preserve the names of those who tried to keep silent about the trouble, and those who tried to blame the dead soldier for everything,\" he wrote on Telegram.Meanwhile, Ukraine's armed forces said they killed or wounded 500 Russian troops in another attack on New Year's Eve, on a village in the occupied southern region of Kherson. There was no independent verification of the attack at Chulakivka, some 20km south of the River Dnipro. Russian forces retreated across the Dnipro in November and Ukrainian officials have posted video of a flag being hoisted on an island between the eastern and western banks of the river.Ukraine's southern military command has warned that it is too early to talk of Velykyi Potomkin island being completely liberated.Commander in chief Valerii Zaluzhny said on Monday that Ukraine had liberated 40% of the territories seized by Russia since last February, and 28% of all territories occupied by Russia since 2014.Russia plans prolonged drone attacks - ZelenskyRussia's war drains Ukraine's rich list of powerDeadly explosions hit Kyiv on New Year's EveNepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare \n",

I want to be a teenager.'When Russia invaded her country, Veronica Ahafonova played piano to drown out the sound of the explosions.We first met the teenager in March when she and her mother were fleeing Kharkiv as refugees, leaving behind everything they knew. They were living in the dark in an overcrowded motel with the curtains shut tight in the hope that Russian bomber planes wouldn't see the building.Like millions of Ukrainian children, Veronica's life changed forever when this war began.Nika, as she likes to be known, told me then that she woke each day amazed that she and her family were still alive: stark words from a 15-year-old. She described rushing to a cramped, cold basement whenever the sirens howled to warn of a Russian attack, and called what she'd been through \"very traumatising\". Ten months on, Nika is living in the UK and says she's finally able to sleep soundly again. \"I needed time to understand that now I'm in a safe place,\" she said, when we met up recently in England. She's staying with a host family and studying for free at the prestigious Charterhouse school, where she's thriving. She now plays piano only for pleasure.\"I don't have air alarms every hour and I don't need to think about what if the next second a bomb is going to be near me,\" Nika says, although she still jumps when a door slams or there's fireworks.\"I don't think it will ever leave me because it's in my mind. But I hope it will.\"Kharkiv, Nika's hometown, is close to Ukraine's northern border with Russia and was heavily shelled for months until Russian troops were forced out of the region in September. Today, the suburb of Saltyvka is lined with the blackened ruins of giant apartment blocks, but in the city centre the rubble and shattered glass we found in March after multiple missile strikes have been cleared away.Patriotic billboards all over town declare that \"Kharkiv is working!\" and the metro, where we last saw whole families sleeping on platforms and curled up inside train carriages, is now running again. But residents are coping with a new problem: no electricity, heat or water for many hours at a time, as Russia targets Ukraine's power supply with its missiles in the middle of winter.Only eight of Nika's 28 classmates are still in Kharkiv and they study remotely these days for safety. But their teacher, Maria, never left. She conducts classes online for students scattered all over the country and even abroad. If the power goes, she switches to using the internet from her mobile phone, lights a candle, then carries on.\"Russia just doesn't know who we are. We're strong, we'll get through this,\" Maria tells me, although she becomes tearful talking about the pupils. \"I just want to hug them,\" she admits. Nika misses her old teacher, too, as well as her Ukrainian friends who went through the same panic-filled days she remembers. \"You can be in the middle of attention [in England], but you are alone, because nobody here understands what I experienced and I hope they never will,\" Nika explains. \"Sometimes I want to talk to them about that,\" she confides. \"But I understand if I tell them everything it may be uncomfortable for them.\"Her mother, Natalia, tells me Nika is coping \"amazingly well\" and that school in the UK is the ideal distraction from thoughts of the ongoing war and destruction at home. Natalia, on the other hand, still has the air-raid app on her phone and can't stop checking for news from Ukraine, not least because her own mother stayed behind in Kharkiv.Nika's grandmother Tamara now lives in the dark for much of the day. The lift in her block of flats no longer works and even when the blackouts end, she tries to use minimal power to conserve it.Like many older people, she didn't want to leave because \"home is home\" but when we went to see her, she said she felt like she was \"living on a powder keg\".\"It's really affecting my nerves,\" she says. \"But then I tell myself to get a grip, that it won't be for long. My girls will be back soon,\" Tamara tells me. \"I live for that moment, though I'm so happy that they are safe.\" The day we dropped in was Nika's 16th birthday, the first year she and her grandmother have been apart. \"She's so grown up!\" Tamara smiles, when she puts the phone down after congratulating her granddaughter, then starts to cry. \"What have they done to us and what for?\" she wants to know. She means the Russians. In England, Nika isn't thinking about the future, for now. \"I want my home back, my previous life back, but I know it's not possible. So maybe I want stability and calmness.

      " the p tags is: When war broke out, millions of Ukrainians had to make a life-changing decision to flee their country - with many hoping to return as soon as possible. But for some disabled refugees, this displacement has offered new opportunities, and they now face a dilemma over whether to ever go home.The Kyrychenko family fled Kyiv as missiles rained down. In the space of an hour the parents had packed up their car with three children, a dog and two guinea pigs. Without time to plan a destination, instinct took over and their safety was all that mattered.Nine months later, they are just some of the 1.4m refugees living in small apartments, rooms and shelters across Poland.This means that their eldest son Roman, who has cerebral palsy and learning disabilities, has been given the chance to go to school for the first time. He is 20 years old. \"Back in Ukraine we were told he was unteachable, that there was no school for him,\" his mum Olga says as she makes packed lunches in the family's small kitchen.For many disabled children and young people in Ukraine, access to education is rare. Before the war, fewer than 3% were enrolled in mainstream school.Roman needs support to walk, and communicates through sounds and facial expressions. While he spent most of his life stuck at home, his younger sister, Sofia, was in full-time education. Now, in Poland, they both leave the house for school.\"Over the years that he didn't go to school, he lost a lot. And we lost a lot as a family,\" Olga says.Widespread abuseBack in Ukraine, Olga and her husband Volodymyr have had to fight to keep Roman from a life in an institution or a \"psycho-neurological boarding facility\". The authorities have spent two decades telling them that their son belongs in one of these places.\"They said, 'Give him away, you can always have another one,'\" Olga says - the determination on her face making clear that this was never an option.More than 50,000 disabled children and young people exist in this system - a network of more than 700 institutions. They are casualties of a Soviet era that encouraged parents to give their disabled child up to the state in the belief children receive better care in an institution.Following that, UN experts demanded that the government urgently continue its de-institutionalisation process - returning children to families, increasing community support and closing facilities which abuse and neglect some of the most vulnerable in society.Now in Poland, Roman starts his day with new purpose. Supported by his dad, he navigates the several flights of stairs from their small apartment in the suburbs of Krakow before a taxi takes him to a specialist school a few miles away.There, his face lights up as his music therapy teacher plays the piano for him. She says the aggression he struggled to contain when he first came to the school back in March has left him, he's a \"happy kid\" who feels at ease and confident in this new environment.He is given one-to-one support and physiotherapy in the school gym and his walking is steadily improving. For the first time, he can mix with his peers and learn new skills.\"I do not understand why he did not go to school in Ukraine,\" the head teacher, Urszula Majcher-Legawiec, says in one of the school's brightly-coloured corridors.\"We know his potential. Roman is constantly improving, he is learning new communication skills, he can tell us what he needs. A place like this is the best place for him.\"\"I am very proud of him that he goes to school,\" Olga beams. \"He goes with pleasure.\"Walking for the first time A few hundred miles away in the north of Poland, I meet another 20-year-old refugee whose world is gradually expanding - but this time from the confines of his bed. Ivan had spent his life lying down in an institution in the east of Ukraine. He is one of 60 disabled evacuees who fled their orphanage in Kharkiv just after the war broke out.It was a gruelling 48-hour journey through Ukraine, during which some were tied to bus seats. Two of them did not survive.\"They were in a terrible condition,\" said Katarzyna Bogumila, a Polish volunteer who has helped care for them since they first arrived.\"They were really skinny. Like dry sticks, and I didn't think it was because of the war. They came to Poland at the end of February and it was just after the invasion. So it couldn't be that - it had to be like a system in Ukraine or something.\"Ivan looks no older than a six-year-old, undernourished after two decades in confinement. His hair a flash of red against his pale skin.Along with the other evacuees, his new home is a former psychiatric hospital in the city of Torun.It has taken months to raise his fragile frame to a sitting position. If they elevated him too quickly there was a chance he could have had a stroke.His view of the world has completely changed - he can now move around in a wheelchair, his face lights up as he is pushed to his physiotherapy. For the first time, he can see the lives of those around him.Other children have also developed. Eleven-year-old Lillia, who has complex disabilities, is walking for the first time. One young man picks up a feather in the sensory room, an experience he has never had. The look of joy at his new-found capability glows on his face.For Katarzyna, this is a short term solution. Her belief chimes with the UN experts who have criticised the Ukrainian government for insisting disabled children remain in a residential setting even when abroad, rather than being supported in the community. The government maintains it is the best way of being able to track the young evacuees and prevent trafficking.\"Every kid should have the chance to be with a family,\" she said.\"I'm hoping they're going to stay in Poland and we can find them families. I can see the difference being here is making every day. It's awesome. I feel like they're my own kids. I don't want to let them go.\"But the situation is complex, illustrated by the dilemma facing the Kyrychenko family. Olga feels the pull of her homeland, but Poland offers so many opportunities for her son. She knows if they return to Ukraine his life will stagnate again.\"Our soul longs to go home while the brain says something different. For Roman, it is better here. It is amazing he can go to school here. \"It's hard to return from good to worse conditions, but abandoning Ukraine - our home is there. I just have to hope that maybe we can bring our experience back to Ukraine and a school for Roman could open there.\"Disabled children abused in Ukraine, warns UNChildren tied up and men in cots in Ukraine orphanagesThe young woman trying to adopt her friendNepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare \n",

He is one of 60 disabled evacuees who fled their orphanage in Kharkiv just after the war broke out.It was a gruelling 48-hour journey through Ukraine, during which some were tied to bus seats. Two of them did not survive.\"They were in a terrible condition,\" said Katarzyna Bogumila, a Polish volunteer who has helped care for them since they first arrived.\"They were really skinny. Like dry sticks, and I didn't think it was because of the war. They came to Poland at the end of February and it was just after the invasion. So it couldn't be that - it had to be like a system in Ukraine or something.\"Ivan looks no older than a six-year-old, undernourished after two decades in confinement. His hair a flash of red against his pale skin.Along with the other evacuees, his new home is a former psychiatric hospital in the city of Torun.It has taken months to raise his fragile frame to a sitting position. If they elevated him too quickly there was a chance he could have had a stroke.His view of the world has completely changed - he can now move around in a wheelchair, his face lights up as he is pushed to his physiotherapy. For the first time, he can see the lives of those around him.Other children have also developed. Eleven-year-old Lillia, who has complex disabilities, is walking for the first time. One young man picks up a feather in the sensory room, an experience he has never had. The look of joy at his new-found capability glows on his face.For Katarzyna, this is a short term solution. Her belief chimes with the UN experts who have criticised the Ukrainian government for insisting disabled children remain in a residential setting even when abroad, rather than being supported in the community. The government maintains it is the best way of being able to track the young evacuees and prevent trafficking.\"Every kid should have the chance to be with a family,\" she said.\"I'm hoping they're going to stay in Poland and we can find them families. I can see the difference being here is making every day. It's awesome. I feel like they're my own kids. I don't want to let them go.\"But the situation is complex, illustrated by the dilemma facing the Kyrychenko family. Olga feels the pull of her homeland, but Poland offers so many opportunities for her son. She knows if they return to Ukraine his life will stagnate again.\"Our soul longs to go home while the brain says something different. For Roman, it is better here. It is amazing he can go to school here. \"It's hard to return from good to worse conditions, but abandoning Ukraine - our home is there. I just have to hope that maybe we can bring our experience back to Ukraine and a school for Roman could open there.\"Disabled children abused in Ukraine, warns UNChildren tied up and men in cots in Ukraine orphanagesThe young woman trying to adopt her friendNepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare\n",

      " the p tags is: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has thanked the US for its military support in the war with Russia.On a visit to Washington this week, Mr Zelensky said US military aid to Ukraine was not charity, but an investment in security for the future.Ukraine has been provided with military equipment by more than 30 countries since the start of the conflict in February.Germany, the UK and Poland have pledged the second, third and fourth largest amounts. Humanitarian, financial and other security assistance brings the US total commitment to Ukraine to $50bn (Â£41bn) - far more than any other country.President Zelensky has said the monthly cost of defence for Ukraine was about $5bn (Â£4.1bn).Military professionals say success on the battlefield requires a huge range of weaponry, as well as training, spare parts and other support.On 21 December, the US announced it was sending the Patriot missile system to Ukraine, in an additional package of nearly $2bn (Â£1.6bn) of security assistance. This highly sophisticated system has a range of up to 160km (100 miles), depending on the type of missile used, and requires specialised training for Ukrainian soldiers, likely to be carried out at a US Army base in Germany. Since the start of the conflict, Ukraine has been using Soviet-era S-300 surface-to-air systems against Russian attacks.The US has also provided Nasams (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) to Ukraine. Two Nasam systems have been in operation in the country for several weeks.In addition, UK has provided several air defence systems, including Starstreak, designed to bring down low-flying aircraft at short range.Analysts say Ukraine badly needs better supplies of artillery and ammunition to hold on to key positions and retake more territory.Among the long-range rocket launchers sent to Ukraine by the US are the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System or Himars. Several European countries have also sent similar systems. Crucially, the range of Himars, and many other systems, varies according to the munitions used, and it is believed that western donors have not provided the ammunition with the longest range.The munitions thought to have been supplied to Ukraine give the system a range of about 50 miles (80km), which is further than the Smerch system on the Russian side.Himars is also much more accurate than the equivalent Russian systems. At the start of July, Australia, Canada and the US had also sent more than 100 M777 howitzers and 300,000 rounds of 155mm ammunition to Ukraine.The range of the M777 is similar to Russia's Giatsint-B howitzer, and much longer than Russia's  D-30 towed gun.At least 5,000 shoulder-launched Nlaw weapons, designed to destroy tanks with a single shot, have been supplied to Ukraine.The weapons are thought to have been particularly important in stopping the advance of Russian forces on Kyiv in the hours and days following the invasion.\"Nlaw was absolutely critical to the defeat of Russian ground thrusts in the early stages of the war,\" according to Justin Bronk of the Royal United Services Institute.The UK has agreed to provide Challenger 2 tanks - the British Army's main battle tank - but it's yet to publicly disclose how many, or when they'll be delivered. The initial commitment is believed to be for around a dozen Challengers.Ukraine has already received more than 230 tanks from Poland and the Czech Republic.Poland's donation of tanks has been partly back-filled by alternative weaponry from allied nations.Ukraine's armed forces have been using T-72s for decades and have maintenance and spare parts capabilities, in addition to trained crew.Drones have featured heavily in the conflict so far, with many used for surveillance, targeting and heavy lift operations.Turkey has sold Bayraktar TB2 armed drones to Ukraine in recent months, whilst the Turkish manufacturer of the system has donated drones to crowd-funding operations in support of Ukraine.Analysts say the Bayraktar TB2s have been extremely effective, flying at about 25,000 feet (7,600m) before descending to attack Russian targets with laser-guided bombs.They have also been used to provide the exact locations of Russian positions for precision artillery strikes.Graphics by Gerry Fletcher and Sana DionysiouNepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare \n",

What's the next level of escalation?\"The fighting in Ukraine has been relatively static in recent weeks, with neither the Russians or Ukrainians making major territorial gains in either the eastern or southern fronts over the winter.Below are some maps illustrating the rough areas of control of either side, as of 11 January.Since these maps were produced, Russia has claimed victory in the mining town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine - although Kyiv disputes this.Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko has warned of \"difficult days\" ahead after Russian missile strikes damaged energy facilities in six Ukrainian regions. In a Facebook post he wrote: \"Today the enemy again attacked the country's generation facilities and electricity networks. There are hits in Kharkiv, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Zaporizhzhia, Vinnytsya and Kyiv regions. \"Emergency outages are being employed in most of the regions because of the strikes.\"Halushchenko added energy specialists were already working to fix the damage, but he warned that the \"coming days will be difficult\".Missile debris from a Russian strike on western Ukraine has been found in neighbouring Moldova, the country's interior ministry has said.Police found the remnants of the strike in Larga, on the border with Ukraine in the north of the country, the ministry wrote on Facebook.The narrow strip of land between the Dniester river and the Ukrainian border, which broke away from Moldova in 1990, is not recognised by the majority of the international community.At least five people have died after a Russian missile struck a residential building in Dnipro, the region's governer has said. Valentyn Reznichenko wrote on Telegram that 27 people have been injured, including six children - all of whom are being treated in hospital. Ukraine's foreign minister has urged the G7 and EU to sanction Russia's missile and drone industry. Speaking in the aftermath of the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukraine on Saturday, Dmytro Kuleba urged the two organisations to implement the relevant sanctions put forward by his country \"without delay\".More now on the situation in Dnipro where a Russian missile hit a residential building earlier.Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidential office, says 15 people have been rescued from the rubble of the nine-storey block of flats in the eastern city.He adds that at least 10 people, including two children, were injured in the strike.We are getting reports of what looks like a second wave of missile attacks across the country. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has reported explosions in the city, adding that air defences were working.And Ukrainian officials have also said that key infrastructure in the Kharkiv and Lviv regions in the east and the west have been hit.A Russian missile has hit a residential building in the city of Dnipro and people are trapped under the rubble, a Ukrainian official has said.Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidential office, posted a picture on Telegram of a block of flats that was badly damaged by an explosion.He said that people who were at home for the St Basil's Day holiday in Ukranie were trapped under the rubble, adding that emergency services were at the scene.As a result of the earlier missile strikes this morning, 11 regions of Ukraine are currently experiencing emergency power cuts to conserve energy.The Ukaniant state energy company, Ukrenergo, wrote on Telegram that round-the-clock\n",
      "consumption limits have been set for all regions until midnight local time.But the power firm said  11 regions had already exceeded this and are currently operating with emergency outages as exceeding the limit risks \"causing emergencies in the energy system\".One of the earlier strikes from this morning hit a residential building in a village near Kyiv, leaving a massive crater in its wake.Confirming the strike, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Ukraine's presidential office, said windows in some homes in the village of Kopyliv in Kyiv Region had been shattered by an explosion wave.No casualties have been reported from the strike on the village, located about 50km (31 miles) from the capital.James WaterhouseUkraine correspondentCities like Kyiv are sadly\n",

What's the next level of escalation?\"The fighting in Ukraine has been relatively static in recent weeks, with neither the Russians or Ukrainians making major territorial gains in either the eastern or southern fronts over the winter.Below are some maps illustrating the rough areas of control of either side, as of 11 January.Since these maps were produced, Russia has claimed victory in the mining town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine - although Kyiv disputes this.Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko has warned of \"difficult days\" ahead after Russian missile strikes damaged energy facilities in six Ukrainian regions. In a Facebook post he wrote: \"Today the enemy again attacked the country's generation facilities and electricity networks. There are hits in Kharkiv, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Zaporizhzhia, Vinnytsya and Kyiv regions. \"Emergency outages are being employed in most of the regions because of the strikes.\"Halushchenko added energy specialists were already working to fix the damage, but he warned that the \"coming days will be difficult\".Missile debris from a Russian strike on western Ukraine has been found in neighbouring Moldova, the country's interior ministry has said.Police found the remnants of the strike in Larga, on the border with Ukraine in the north of the country, the ministry wrote on Facebook.The narrow strip of land between the Dniester river and the Ukrainian border, which broke away from Moldova in 1990, is not recognised by the majority of the international community.At least five people have died after a Russian missile struck a residential building in Dnipro, the region's governer has said. Valentyn Reznichenko wrote on Telegram that 27 people have been injured, including six children - all of whom are being treated in hospital. Ukraine's foreign minister has urged the G7 and EU to sanction Russia's missile and drone industry. Speaking in the aftermath of the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukraine on Saturday, Dmytro Kuleba urged the two organisations to implement the relevant sanctions put forward by his country \"without delay\".More now on the situation in Dnipro where a Russian missile hit a residential building earlier.Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidential office, says 15 people have been rescued from the rubble of the nine-storey block of flats in the eastern city.He adds that at least 10 people, including two children, were injured in the strike.We are getting reports of what looks like a second wave of missile attacks across the country. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has reported explosions in the city, adding that air defences were working.And Ukrainian officials have also said that key infrastructure in the Kharkiv and Lviv regions in the east and the west have been hit.A Russian missile has hit a residential building in the city of Dnipro and people are trapped under the rubble, a Ukrainian official has said.Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidential office, posted a picture on Telegram of a block of flats that was badly damaged by an explosion.He said that people who were at home for the St Basil's Day holiday in Ukranie were trapped under the rubble, adding that emergency services were at the scene.As a result of the earlier missile strikes this morning, 11 regions of Ukraine are currently experiencing emergency power cuts to conserve energy.The Ukaniant state energy company, Ukrenergo, wrote on Telegram that round-the-clock\n",
      "consumption limits have been set for all regions until midnight local time.But the power firm said  11 regions had already exceeded this and are currently operating with emergency outages as exceeding the limit risks \"causing emergencies in the energy system\".One of the earlier strikes from this morning hit a residential building in a village near Kyiv, leaving a massive crater in its wake.Confirming the strike, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Ukraine's presidential office, said windows in some homes in the village of Kopyliv in Kyiv Region had been shattered by an explosion wave.No casualties have been reported from the strike on the village, located about 50km (31 miles) from the capital.James WaterhouseUkraine correspondentCities like Kyiv are sadly\n",

A Telegram channel associated with Yevgeny Prigozhin, boss of Russian mercenary group Wagner, earlier released an image of a document which had the name of that charity and Mr Parry's permission to operate as a volunteer.

We've been able to verify the location by comparing the video with other confirmed images of the hospital.Mr Parry and Mr Bagshaw, 48, were believed to have headed to the heavily bombarded front-line town of Soledar on Friday 6 January. In an Instagram post, a friend of theirs - also working as a volunteer - said that the pair had made the journey to carry out evacuations. \"If you have any information on the whereabouts of the boys, or have seen their car (Black Land Rover, AFIO HWU), please contact me or the police,\" the friend added.There are lots of groups in the area, which include foreigners, who help with evacuations of civilians and bring food and supplies to people.  BBC correspondent Yogita Limaye and producer Imogen Anderson met Mr Parry, from Truro in Cornwall, on new year's day in the city of Kramatorsk, in the eastern Donbas region. They had been looking to report on Bakhmut, the scene of intense fighting, and the volunteers working there.He told them he had been staying in the city for about six weeks, and had just acquired a new 4x4 through a fundraiser he had started two months before. He told the BBC journalists that he had to abandon his old car in Bakhmut the previous week. It had been \"shot by a tank\" he posted on Instagram at the time.

The journalists were on their way to Bakhmut on 2 January when Mr Parry got in touch to say he was also going into the city. But once they reached Bakhmut they lost reception and that was the last contact they had with the volunteer. The following day, Mr Parry gave an interview to BBC Radio Cornwall and described a close encounter he'd had with a drone in the Bakhmut area.Mr Parry said that he was staying in a town 10 miles from the front line and explained his motivation was to help children particularly. \"To be able to get them out of these war-torn areas, it makes it definitely more worthwhile than anything else that I can imagine.\"In a previous interview with the same station in November 2022, he said he had become \"obsessed\" with Ukraine after the invasion, realised he could not fight and decided it would be more useful for him to get a van and help evacuate civilians.Mr Parry told the journalist he had been volunteering as an evacuation driver. \"I receive requests from family members who ask us to go and collect their relatives.\"Describing an evacuation, he said there had been \"lots of Ukrainian missiles...  a lot of small arms firing\". He said: \"A lot of volunteers won't go anymore, but there are people there who want to get out, so I'm willing to go.\"Mr Parry said he used a vehicle for evacuations - his black Land Rover is seen in the video.Mr De Decker spoke to BBC Radio Cornwall on Thursday about the interview on 3 January.

He played rugby back in Ukraine.The club is helping to fundraise for generators and aid to be sent to families without power in Ukraine, including the agricultural area Vadym and his family originate from.Club secretary Paul Baker says: \"I think the whole area has embraced them because we have some refugees in our own village we've helped come across. \"It's great that we can integrate people into a more normal life while they're here. We're very pleased to be able to help.\"I hope that in due course Vadym will be able to invite the club to tour in Ukraine and play rugby there. \"That is the world of rugby, touring and meeting people and enjoying each other's countries - it's part of what this club does.\" Fears as UK sponsorship ends for thousands of UkrainiansLife with Ukrainian family is enriching, says hostNew crisis looms for Ukrainians in the UKThe Ukraine friends forging new lives in SheffieldSalon On The GreenSt Neots Rugby ClubCoupleâs food delivery service hoping to rival Just Eat, Uber Eats and DeliverooAddenbrookes Neurosurgeon given prestigious award for 'cutting-edge research'Roadworks across Cambridgeshire to look out for this weekWorst place to live in England 2023: Voting open as shortlist revealed - including York and OxfordA fresh outlook for 2023Murder victim who died of multiple stab wounds is namedNepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare\n",

      " the p tags is: Russia has not taken a key town or city in Ukraine for months, despite intense efforts to achieve military gains. If Russian forces seize the eastern town of Soledar, their hope is that the course of the war could change.When Russian mercenary leader Yevgeniy Prigozhin announced his Wagner units had taken control of the entire territory of Soledar, the images produced looked convincing.But Wagner fighters are not part of the regular Russian armed forces and the defence ministry in Moscow says the battle is still going on. Ukraine's president also says the fight is continuing and Kyiv is adamant the Russians are not succeeding in their push to capture the town.The fall of Soledar may help Russian troops in their assault on the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, about 10km (6 miles) to the south west, providing them with a secure artillery position within range of the city.  Soledar also has deep salt mines, which could be used to station troops and store equipment, protected from Ukrainian missiles.The mines have an extensive underground network of tunnels, which could be of strategic importance as Russian forces attempt to penetrate Ukrainian-controlled territory.  It is not clear, however, how much of this network is accessible and where it might lead.Soledar's mines also contain valuable salt and gypsum, which could provide an important source of revenue for anyone who controls and is able to extract resources from it.But perhaps one of the most important factors in the battle for Soledar is a symbolic one. \"The reason they are throwing everything at it,\" says the BBC's James Waterhouse in Ukraine, \"is that there is a big propaganda win hereâ¦ a vital trophy for President Vladimir Putin to present to critics back in Russia\".Taking control of the nearby city Bakhmut would certainly be a prize for Russian forces in the region. \"This would be a much needed boost for Russian forces in the east who have been under real pressure since September,\" says Edward Arnold, a European security researcher at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). However, he adds that \"the seizure of Bakhmut will have little strategic significance for the outcome of the war\". The Wagner Group has become increasingly influential in the Ukraine conflict and Mr Prigozhin has been behind its advance on the battlefield.He claims his fighters are the only ones fighting in Soledar, although the Russian defence ministry says its forces are also taking part.The battle for Soledar and Bakhmut is only part of the front line and the broader campaign is not going well for Vladimir Putin.Russia again replaced the head of its regular forces in Ukraine only three months after he was put in place, in another sign of dissatisfaction at the lack of progress.\"[Prigozhin will] continue to use both confirmed and fabricated Wagner Group success in Soledar and Bakhmut,\" says the Institute for the Study of War \"to promote [it] as the only Russian force in Ukraine capable of securing tangible gains.\"Reporting by Jake Horton and Tom Spencer.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsNepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare \n",

      " the p tags is: Last week in Las Vegas I boxed, hunted for cute aliens, flew a laser-shooting robot and drew my own masterpiece - all in virtual reality. Some of the headsets I used to try out these experiences cost almost twice as much as the smartphone we used to snap the photo above. Arguably they have a lot less functionality, for now at least. So are they worth it?HTC's new Vive XR Elite, out next month, will cost Â£1,299 or $1,099. Meta's Quest Pro launched a couple of months ago, priced at Â£1,499 or $1,499. The hardware involved in VR has often been described as off-putting and, to be fair, it once was. Early headsets were renowned for being clunky and heavy, and many required tethering by cables to a high-end PC, powerful enough to process the graphics.These new headsets are comparatively lighter and far more portable. The Vive XR Elite folds up into a case about the size of a tub of peanuts. HTC's newer headsets come with a clever little bit of internal design - you can adjust the lenses to correct common vision impairments, which is good news for short-sighted people like me who do not enjoy wearing glasses and a headset at the same time. Both headsets lean much more towards mixed reality than the previous total immersive experience - you can always see your physical surroundings out of the sides of the Meta Quest Pro. Most of the demos I tried with the HTC had the real world displayed via a camera behind the graphics. This meant my colleague Ammie avoided getting punched on the nose when my virtual boxing target ended up directly in front of where he was standing in real life.I am using VR in this article as an umbrella term, and I think it is mixed reality, also known as augmented reality or AR, that is most likely to catch on. It is less about completely losing yourself in a virtual world - which is unsustainable for very long - and more about digitally enhancing your existing one, or flitting seamlessly between the two. That, in theory, will keep you in your headset for longer, or as long as the two-hour battery lifespan permits. The HTC Holoride, for example, is designed for car passengers. It's a set of games that move in sync with the speed of the vehicle you are in. If the car stops at red lights, so does your flying robot.It's neat, but costs â¬900 (Â£800), and there are only 10 games. My kids would probably like it, but I'm not sure for how long it would hold their attention.The Quest Pro demo was, to be honest, a bit odd. I had to use a kind of magical torch to search the floor for an alien, rabbit-like creature, who then bounced through the wall into a fantasy land, into which I was not allowed to step. I then met an avatar with a youthful green face and pink flower petals for hair, who mimicked my facial expressions. It was, said Meta, an example of how I could appear in its metaverse, once it's built. Famously, existing Meta avatars don't yet have legs (Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg said at the Quest Pro launch that \"legs are hard\") and Flower Zoe was no exception.

      "Last week in Las Vegas I boxed, hunted for cute aliens, flew a laser-shooting robot and drew my own masterpiece - all in virtual reality. Some of the headsets I used to try out these experiences cost almost twice as much as the smartphone we used to snap the photo above. Arguably they have a lot less functionality, for now at least. So are they worth it?HTC's new Vive XR Elite, out next month, will cost Â£1,299 or $1,099. Meta's Quest Pro launched a couple of months ago, priced at Â£1,499 or $1,499. The hardware involved in VR has often been described as off-putting and, to be fair, it once was. Early headsets were renowned for being clunky and heavy, and many required tethering by cables to a high-end PC, powerful enough to process the graphics.These new headsets are comparatively lighter and far more portable. The Vive XR Elite folds up into a case about the size of a tub of peanuts. HTC's newer headsets come with a clever little bit of internal design - you can adjust the lenses to correct common vision impairments, which is good news for short-sighted people like me who do not enjoy wearing glasses and a headset at the same time. Both headsets lean much more towards mixed reality than the previous total immersive experience - you can always see your physical surroundings out of the sides of the Meta Quest Pro. Most of the demos I tried with the HTC had the real world displayed via a camera behind the graphics. This meant my colleague Ammie avoided getting punched on the nose when my virtual boxing target ended up directly in front of where he was standing in real life.I am using VR in this article as an umbrella term, and I think it is mixed reality, also known as augmented reality or AR, that is most likely to catch on. It is less about completely losing yourself in a virtual world - which is unsustainable for very long - and more about digitally enhancing your existing one, or flitting seamlessly between the two. That, in theory, will keep you in your headset for longer, or as long as the two-hour battery lifespan permits. The HTC Holoride, for example, is designed for car passengers. It's a set of games that move in sync with the speed of the vehicle you are in. If the car stops at red lights, so does your flying robot.It's neat, but costs â¬900 (Â£800), and there are only 10 games. My kids would probably like it, but I'm not sure for how long it would hold their attention.The Quest Pro demo was, to be honest, a bit odd. I had to use a kind of magical torch to search the floor for an alien, rabbit-like creature, who then bounced through the wall into a fantasy land, into which I was not allowed to step. I then met an avatar with a youthful green face and pink flower petals for hair, who mimicked my facial expressions. It was, said Meta, an example of how I could appear in its metaverse, once it's built. Famously, existing Meta avatars don't yet have legs (Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg said at the Quest Pro launch that \"legs are hard\") and Flower Zoe was no exception. It was captivating, but also curiously detaching to watch this creature behave just like me.But it's still a novelty, rather than part of the fabric of our lives. Outside the tech sphere, many people I know have either never tried it, or maybe tried something once or twice in an arcade.A word of warning though - I have come away from my week-long VR-fest with a spot of real-life conjunctivitis - so make sure those headsets get cleaned!

It's part of history,\" enthuses Oliver, who is French. Mark from Maryland says he came for \"the spirituality, to be able to walk in the footsteps of Jesus\".This month is peak season for pilgrims as Western - and then Eastern - Orthodox churches celebrate Epiphany. The holiday marks both the visit of the Three Wise Men, or Magi, to a new-born Jesus, and his later baptism by the prophet John. Recently, Jordan announced an ambitious $100m (Â£83m) plan aimed at drawing a million Christians to al-Maghtas in 2030, to commemorate what is seen as the 2,000th anniversary of Jesus's baptism.It promises a biblical village and the largest Christian pilgrimage and interfaith centre in the region, recognising that the River Jordan and its valley is also loaded with religious importance for Jews and Muslims.\"It's always great to have our visitors, our pilgrims, experience what John and Jesus did,\" says Rustom Mkhjian, director general of Jordan's baptism site.  \"I call it 'the fifth gospel', as you physically see what you read in all the four gospels. Truly you feel in the midst of religious history and faith.\"Among the many features he points out is a native plant popular with bees, called yanbout or locust pod, reminding me that the Bible describes St John dressed in his camel-hair garments, eating \"locusts and wild honey\".The baptism site, also known as Bethany Beyond the Jordan, is a Unesco World Heritage site, where the ruins of Roman and Byzantine churches, a monastery and baptism pools are preserved among the wilderness near to the lowest point on Earth.They were uncovered in 1995 after Jordan's peace treaty with Israel.Prior to that, both sides of the river had been a closed military zone since the 1967 Middle East War, in which Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and occupied it.\"The rediscovery of the site is one of the fruits of peace,\" Mr Mkhjian tells me. \"Imagine, 11 huge minefields were demined. I'm talking about tens of thousands of mines were taken away. Isn't it great to have millions of pilgrims instead of mines?\"Although the Jordanians vie with the Israeli-controlled side of the river for tourists, in the past two decades three Catholic popes, two popes from the Coptic Church and church leaders from all over the world have visited al-Maghtas.  The rich and famous have had their children baptised here, and Jordan's royal court has sent the holy waters for British royal christenings.On the invitation of the Jordanian authorities, different Christian denominations have built new churches here, with more planned.  It makes for a rare sight in the Middle East.\"It's heart-warming,\" an American visitor, Sharon, tells me, praising the initiative by Jordan's Muslim royal family. \"We're learning how much we all have in common, and that the Jordanian government is establishing all of this to give each and every denomination they can find the right to share in the property here.\"The masterplan for the new 340-acre baptism zone, next to the Unesco site, was unveiled last month by King Abdullah. Samir Murad, who chairs the non-profit foundation set up by the Jordanian government to oversee the project, insists the integrity of the area will be maintained.\"It would be foolish and unwise to try and create a touristic destination that's based on commercialisation and theme park-type issues in a site so holy,\" he says. \"Let's remember this is the third-holiest site in Christianity. This is the site where Jesus got his calling and so it would be highly inappropriate, if you will, to corrupt it or violate in any way.\"Plans for the new development include so-called glamping-style lodging and eateries, serving locally grown organic food.

      " the p tags is: Converting people to another religion is illegal in Nepal, but missionaries are willing to risk prosecution to spread the Christian faith. \"Victory to Jesus,\" Korean pastor Pang Chang-in cries as he blesses a new church in the village of Jharlang, in the foothills of the Himalayas.   The congregation of the newly converted raise their hands in prayer. Most are from the indigenous Tamang community, who used to follow the Lama faith, an ancient spiritual practice.  In Pang's eyes the Tamang people are \"poor financially and spiritually\".   \"So, a miracle takes place and the whole village converts,\" he says.  Missionaries, many of them South Korean like Pang, have helped build one of the world's fastest-growing Christian communities in Nepal, a former Hindu kingdom and the birthplace of Lord Buddha. Most of the surge in Christian numbers in Nepal is from among members of the community who call themselves Dalits - traditionally at the bottom of the Hindu caste hierarchy - or from indigenous people.They may believe in miracles as Pang suggests, but for them conversion also offers a chance to escape entrenched poverty and discrimination. Pang has overseen the opening of nearly 70 churches in his two decades in Nepal, mostly in Dhading district, two hours north-west of the capital Kathmandu. The community, he says, donates the land and Korean churches help pay for the construction.\"In almost every mountain valley, churches are being built,\" Pang claims. That may be an exaggeration, but there's no doubt there has been a huge increase in the number of churches all over Nepal in recent years. The latest data from the national Christian community survey says there are now 7,758 churches in the still overwhelmingly Hindu country. And South Korea is behind much of this transformation. It has become one of the world's biggest missionary-sending nations - only a couple of decades after it started deploying them - with more than 22,000 abroad, according to the Korean World Mission Association.Driven by the zeal of the born-again, Korean missionaries have become known for aggressively going to, and sometimes being expelled from, the hardest-to-evangelise corners of the world.Nepal is now a secular state, and the 2015 constitution enshrines religious freedom. However, an anti-conversion law that came into force in 2018 means anyone convicted of encouraging someone to change their faith faces up to five years in jail.   \"We are always working with the anxiety and nervousness we feel from the anti-conversion law,\" says Pang's wife, Lee Jeong-hee. \"But we can't stop the spread of the gospel because of this fear. We will not stop saving souls.\"The couple used to be bankers. Lee Jeong-hee says it was her husband \"who first received God's calling [and] shortly after God beckoned us to move to Nepal\". When they arrived in 2003, a Hindu royal family was still on the throne. \"I was shocked to see so many idols being worshipped,\" says Pang.  \"I felt Nepal was in desperate need of the gospel.\" \"This began the golden age for missionary work,\" declares Pang.  He and his wife are part of a community of around 300 Korean missionary families currently in Nepal.   In Kathmandu the Korean community is largely clustered around the southern suburbs of the capital.None of the congregation are officially missionaries. They're on business or study visas.  Some run restaurants, while others have registered charities.    In the weeks we spent with the Korean missionary community, Pang and his wife were the only ones willing to speak openly. \"I'm open to sharing what God is doing in Nepal,\" says Pang.   He doesn't view their work as breaking the law, because in his mind they are not openly proselytising or baptising.  \"Our missionary work is not just about us. God is doing the work. We'd like to show how God works through us to create miracles in Nepal,\" he says. In 1951 there were no Christians in Nepal and just 458 in 1961. But by 2011, there were nearly 376,000 and the latest census estimates the community is now around 545,000.     \"It's spreading like wildfire. The cultural identity is at stake. The fabric of the national unity is at stake,\" argues former deputy prime minister, Kamal Thapa.He views the Korean missionary work as an \"organised attack on the cultural identity of the country\". \"Missionaries are working behind the scenes and exploiting the poor and ignorant people and encouraging them to convert to Christianity.\"This is not a case of religious freedom. This is a case of exploitation in the name of religion,\" he says. He is lobbying for Nepal to return to being a Hindu state.  He supported the introduction of the anti-conversion law and would like to see it being enforced.     It's only Christians who have been charged under the law, but no-one has been convicted. Cases have either been thrown out due to a lack of evidence or defendants have been acquitted on appeal. There are currently five active cases, according to the Nepal Christian Society. Charges against four Koreans, including two nuns, were dropped in December.   Pastor Dilli Ram Paudel, who heads the Nepal Christian Society, was one of the first people to be questioned under the law.He was accused in April 2018 of bribing people to convert, something he strongly denies. Charges against him were also later dropped. \"We're accused of converting people, but that power is not in our hands,\" he says.  \"If it was, I could convert my mum. She is 92 - I can give her money, I can pray for her, but I can't convert her because conversion should come from Jesus.\" He comes from a devout Hindu family and was ordained a Hindu priest \"like 21 generations before me\". In his 20s he went to study in Korea and that's where he was introduced to Christianity. \"I was alone and friendless,\" he recalls, \"and then some people gave me a Korean bible in the Nepali language. Somehow they found the Nepali language one.\"   He read it in one night and \"found my creator\".\"Does it seem funny and not believable? Well, that happened to me,\" he says with a smile.  On his return he was ostracised by his family. \"They said Christianity was a foreign religion [and] some people said that I was mad, that I had lost my memory,\" he says.  It's taken time for him to be accepted back into his family and community. Each year more than 2,000 Nepali students travel to Korea to study.  A Korean missionary who spoke on condition of anonymity says they try to connect with local churches in Korea.    \"Doing evangelical work within Nepal is a challenge. So we have alternative ways,\" he says. \"Our mission is to convert - as Pastor Dilli Ram Paudel was a Hindu priest when he was younger - any souls we can, so we must remain under cover.\" Pang and his wife help run a seminary school in Kathmandu.  There are around 50 students currently studying. Korean church donors mostly cover the cost of their education and board.One of them, 22-year-old Sapana, comes from the remote Tamang village of Singang. \"My father loathed churchgoers, as he believed we shouldn't forget our traditions,\" she says.  It was her uncle who introduced her to Christianity when she was gravely ill.  She claims she was healed after converting. \"I wanted to live for Jesus. Someone finally loved me,\" she says. Remote villages like hers are the new frontier for Korean missionaries like Pang Chang-in.   \"In the cities, the anti-conversion law feels much more real. But in the countryside, there are less eyes watching,\" says Pang.Sapana graduated from the seminary late last year. She now plans to return to her mountain village \"to slowly grow and push youth to be part of the church\".\"I will go to new places and spread the message of Jesus to those who have not heard it before.\" Pang Chang-in admits the spread of the gospel \"can clash with existing religion and culture\".But his view is that this \"culture shock is unavoidable\".

She is 92 - I can give her money, I can pray for her, but I can't convert her because conversion should come from Jesus.\" He comes from a devout Hindu family and was ordained a Hindu priest \"like 21 generations before me\". In his 20s he went to study in Korea and that's where he was introduced to Christianity. \"I was alone and friendless,\" he recalls, \"and then some people gave me a Korean bible in the Nepali language. Somehow they found the Nepali language one.\"   He read it in one night and \"found my creator\".\"Does it seem funny and not believable? Well, that happened to me,\" he says with a smile.  On his return he was ostracised by his family. \"They said Christianity was a foreign religion [and] some people said that I was mad, that I had lost my memory,\" he says.  It's taken time for him to be accepted back into his family and community. Each year more than 2,000 Nepali students travel to Korea to study.  A Korean missionary who spoke on condition of anonymity says they try to connect with local churches in Korea.    \"Doing evangelical work within Nepal is a challenge. So we have alternative ways,\" he says. \"Our mission is to convert - as Pastor Dilli Ram Paudel was a Hindu priest when he was younger - any souls we can, so we must remain under cover.\" Pang and his wife help run a seminary school in Kathmandu.  There are around 50 students currently studying. Korean church donors mostly cover the cost of their education and board.One of them, 22-year-old Sapana, comes from the remote Tamang village of Singang. \"My father loathed churchgoers, as he believed we shouldn't forget our traditions,\" she says.  It was her uncle who introduced her to Christianity when she was gravely ill.  She claims she was healed after converting. \"I wanted to live for Jesus. Someone finally loved me,\" she says. Remote villages like hers are the new frontier for Korean missionaries like Pang Chang-in.   \"In the cities, the anti-conversion law feels much more real. But in the countryside, there are less eyes watching,\" says Pang.Sapana graduated from the seminary late last year. She now plans to return to her mountain village \"to slowly grow and push youth to be part of the church\".\"I will go to new places and spread the message of Jesus to those who have not heard it before.\" Pang Chang-in admits the spread of the gospel \"can clash with existing religion and culture\".But his view is that this \"culture shock is unavoidable\".

      " the p tags is: As Canada prepares to expand its euthanasia law to include those with mental illness, some Canadians - including many of the country's doctors - question whether the country's assisted death programme has already moved too far, too fast.Dr Madeline Li can recall the first patient she helped die, about one month after Canada first legalised euthanasia in 2016. \"I remember just how surreal it was,\" she said. A psychiatrist at Toronto's Princess Margaret Hospital, she recalled checking on her patient that day, asking if she had the right music and final meal, and if she was sure she wanted to go ahead. The patient, in her mid-60s and suffering from ovarian cancer, said she was.Five minutes later, the woman was dead. \"It was like stepping off a cliff, that first one,\" Dr Li said. \"Then time passes and it normalises.\" She has since overseen hundreds of medically assisted dying cases. Dr Li stressed repeatedly that a physician's personal opinions should not influence how they assess a patient for assisted death. But she has significant concerns about the expansion of Canada's euthanasia and assisted dying programme beyond the terminally ill. She is not alone. Since 2016, Canada's medical assistance in dying programme - known by its acronym 'Maid' - has been available for adults with terminal illness. In 2021, the law was changed to include those with serious and chronic physical conditions, even if that condition was non-life threatening. This year, it is expected to change again to include some Canadians with mental illness. That planned expansion has ignited controversy over the assisted death programme as a whole and raised concerns that it may be too easy for the vulnerable to die in Canada. Those fears have been stoked by a recent string of reports suggesting that for some, death has been used as a stopgap for a broken social safety net.\"Making death too ready a solution disadvantages the most vulnerable people, and actually lets society off the hook,\" Dr Li said. \"I don't think death should be society's solution for its own failures.\"Medically assisted death arrived in Canada through the courts. In 2015, the country's Supreme Court ruled that banning assisted suicide deprived Canadians of their dignity and autonomy. It gave Parliament one year to draft legislation.The 2016 law legalised assisted death for Canadians aged 18 and older with a serious and irreversible condition, whose death was \"reasonably foreseeable\". In that first year, a little over 1,000 people received an assisted death, a number that has grown every year since. In 2021, the most recent figures available, there were 10,064 Maid cases, accounting for 3.3% of all deaths in Canada.Opinion polls indicate Canadians broadly support access to at least some form of assisted suicide. Death for the terminally ill can often be cruel and slow, physicians told the BBC, with the patient's final days spent slipping in and out of a drugged consciousness. The existence of assisted dying in these cases, doctors said, became a salve. \"Almost every single time I deem a patient eligible [for Maid], that patient stops worrying about how they're going to die and starts wondering how they're going to live,\" said Dr Stefanie Green, president of the Canadian Association of Maid Assessors and Providers. \"It is objectively therapeutic to give someone the option,\"she said.Canada's expansion to Maid last year followed another court decision after two people from Montreal with degenerative diseases launched a legal challenge.The ruling put Canada in the company of just a handful of countries, including Belgium and the Netherlands, that allow medically assisted dying for those without a terminal illness.  The change included people whose sole medical condition was mental illness, but with a caveat: psychiatric Maid applications would be delayed for two years, while the federal government set up appropriate safeguards.The looming expansion has attracted intense scrutiny and, for some, cast doubt on the country's assisted dying programme for the non-terminally ill. Early critics of the programme include three United Nations human rights experts, who wrote to the federal government in 2021 warning that the expanded law could devalue the lives of disabled people by implying that a serious disability was worse than death. A number of reports suggesting that some Canadians have opted for assisted death, at least in part because they could not afford adequate housing, have also prompted fears it could be used as a solution for societal challenges - that someone may seek out Maid because of poverty, lack of housing, or extreme loneliness. \"Leaving people to make this choice [to die] because the state is failing to fulfil their fundamental human rights is unacceptable,\" said Marie-Claud Landry, chief commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights Commission in a statement in May.Others have pointed to what they describe as the programme's flimsy safeguards. \"The Maid law is very Canadian. It was left so vague it could offend nobody,\" Dr Li said. The law, she said, \"is not specific enough to protect people.\"This video can not be playedShould people with a mental illness be helped to die?In 2019, 61-year-old Alan Nichols opted for an assisted death after he was admitted to a British Columbia hospital for suicide watch. In the days before his death, he was agitated, confused, and refused to wear the cochlear implant that helped him hear, his sister-in-law Trish Nichols told a Senate committee last year. On his application for Maid, the stated reason was \"hearing loss\".\"Alan did not have a valid diagnosis for Maid,\" Mrs Nichols said. \"Would you feel safe now, bringing your suicidal loved one to seek medical care for recovery when there are no oversight or stringent safeguards surrounding a procedure that kills people?\"Then last autumn, authorities launched an investigation after at least four veterans were prompted to consider Maid by a Veterans Affairs case worker, who now no longer works for the department. In one instance, veteran and paralympian Christine Gauthier said she was offered the option by the employee after she asked for a wheelchair ramp to be installed in her home.The federal government says that the expanded law protects vulnerable Canadians while respecting patient autonomy. Applicants with grievous and incurable but non-life threatening conditions must be assessed by two separate clinicians and undergo a 90-day waiting period. And proponents of assisted dying insist the existing guardrails are strong enough. \"I see the safeguards in place, I see them working,\" said Dr Green. \"I'm not naÃ ̄ve, I get it, lack of support in our community - disability support, income support, housing support - these things contribute to a person's suffering,\" she said. \"But in and of itself, if that's what is motivating people to apply, they will not be found eligible.\" Derryck Smith, a Vancouver psychiatrist and board member for Dying with Dignity, told the BBC that the standards ensure that only a small fraction of Canadians without terminal diagnoses would be eligible for Maid. \"Look at the statistics,\" he said.In 2021, the average age of a Maid recipient was 76. Eighty percent had received palliative care and 65% had cancer. But planned inclusion of mental health has prompted yet another set of concerns. Last month, facing mounting criticism, the Canadian government said it would seek to pause the inclusion of mental illness - scheduled for this March - to allow for additional study.  \"We want to be prudent, we want to move in a step-by-step way, so we don't make mistakes,\" federal Justice Minister David Lametti said. Much of the controversy is focused on the \"irremediability\" of a mental illness - meaning if it's incurable - and how that could be assessed. For a person to be eligible for Maid in Canada, their condition must be considered irremediable. The Canadian Mental Health Association has warned it is \"not possible\" to determine whether any particular case of mental illness is incurable and strongly opposes the coming expansion. Some leading psychiatrists, like University of Toronto's Karandeep Sonu Gaind, have said the odds of predicting curability are worse than a coin flip. It is now unclear when Canada's assisted dying law will be expanded to include mental illness. Mr Lametti did not say how long the extension would be, but there is no indication the pause is anything but temporary, as such a move would likely be deemed unconstitutional by the courts.\"We are listening to what we are hearing and being responsive,\" Mr Lametti said last month. \"We know we need to get this right.\"Dr Li has celebrated the government's decision to delay, saying healthcare providers may now have a chance to set up adequate safeguards. \"The time for debating 'should we do this' is over,\" she said. \"What we need to start talking about is when and how we're going to do it right.\" If you want to talk to someone about the issues raised in this piece, you can call the US Suicide and Crisis Lifeline on 988.Canada proposes expanding access to assisted dyingWhat is assisted suicide and euthanasia?Portuguese parliament backs assisted suicide billNepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare \n",

      " the p tags is: This video can not be playedWatch: Thousands of Israelis hold legal reforms protest in Tel AvivMore than 80,000 Israeli protesters have rallied in Tel Aviv against plans by the new right-wing coalition government to overhaul the judiciary.The reforms would make it easier for parliament to overturn Supreme Court rulings, among other things.Protesters described Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposed changes as an attack on democratic rule.It follows the instalment of the most religious and hardline government in Israeli history.Rallies were also held outside the prime minister's residence in Jerusalem and in the northern city of Haifa, local media reported.One group of protesters clashed with police while attempting to block a major road, Ayalon highway, in Tel Aviv.Critics say the reforms would cripple judicial independence, foster corruption, set back minority rights and deprive Israel's court system of credibility.Banners referred to the new coalition led by Mr Netanyahu as a government of shame.Among those opposed are Israel's Supreme Court chief justice, Esther Hayat, and the country's attorney-general.The BBC's Samantha Granville in Tel Aviv saw protesters draped in Israeli flags, carrying posters in Hebrew, and pictures of Mr Netanyahu with X's over his mouth.There was a group of young girls with red-painted hand prints over their mouths. They wanted to tell the government they won't be quiet.One woman, who asked not to use her name, said through her tears she was a second-generation Holocaust survivor.\"My parents immigrated from non-democratic regimes to live in a democracy,\" she said. \"They came from the totalitarian regime to live freely. So seeing that destroyed is heart-breaking.\"She and her friend said they expected Mr Netanyahu to try radical changes, but never thought they would come so fast.These are the largest demonstrations since Mr Netanyahu's new coalition government was sworn in, in December.Opposition parties had called on Israelis to join the rallies to \"save democracy\" and in protest at the planned judicial overhaul.Under the plans announced by Justice Minister Yariv Levin earlier this month, a simple majority in the Knesset (parliament) would have the power to effectively annul Supreme Court rulings. This could enable the government of the day to pass legislation without fear of it being struck down.Critics fear the new government could use this to scrap Mr Netanyahu's ongoing criminal trial, although the government has not said it would do that.Mr Netanyahu is being tried on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust - something he strongly denies.The reforms would also give politicians more influence over the appointment of judges, with most members of the selection committee coming from the ruling coalition.If it passes into law, the plan could make it easier for the government to legislate in favour of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank without worrying about challenges in the Supreme Court.Israel has previously highlighted the power of the court to rule against it, as a way of blunting international criticism of such moves.Israel plan to curb court powers sparks outcryIsrael's hard-line new government takes officePalestinian fears heightened as Israeli far right heads to powerNepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare \n",

      " the p tags is: An ageing pipeline crossing part of the Great Lakes has led to a standoff between the US state of Michigan and Canada. The outcome of the battle over Line 5, which delivers energy to the US Midwest and central Canada, will be viewed by many as a bellwether of how North America will balance its energy future with its environmental commitments.  The most contentious part of the Line 5 pipeline - which runs from Superior, Wisconsin, by way of Michigan to Sarnia, Canada - sits on the bed of the Straits of Mackinac. The narrow waterway connects Lake Michigan and Lake Huron - two of the world's largest lakes. In 2018, an anchor from a shipping freighter passing through the Straits struck and damaged the pipe, bringing to the fore longstanding concerns from environmental campaigners and others over possible spills.  Then-Michigan Governor Rick Snyder made an agreement with Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge to protect the pipeline from further damage and keep it operational. Enbridge, one of the world's largest pipeline firms, would build a $500m (Â£411m) tunnel bored through rock below the lakebed in the Straits, to enclose Line 5.The agreement was meant to end uncertainty about the controversial 69-year-old oil and natural gas pipeline's safety. But two years later, Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Mr Snyder's Democratic successor and a long-time opponent of Line 5, ordered the company to cease operations in the Straits, effectively shutting Line 5 down. She called it an \"unreasonable risk\" to the Great Lakes, one of the largest sources of fresh water in the world and an economic engine for the region. Now, there is no end in sight for the ongoing battle over the fate of the project, the pipeline and the need to protect the Great Lakes. Permits and a safety and environmental impact assessment for the project - which would take years to complete - are still pending. And Enbridge has ignored Gov Whitmer's order to halt, setting things up for a lengthy and contentious court battle.Enbridge says the pipeline, which earns it an estimated $1.6-$2m daily, has been operating safely and reliably in the Straits for decades. In turn, Michigan has sued the company to enforce the Line 5 shutdown. The case is currently before a US federal court.Calgary-based Enbridge has Canada in its corner.Line 5 is part of the Lakehead System, a network of pipelines that brings oil and natural gas from western Canada to homes and refineries in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Ontario and Quebec.It provides the majority of the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec's crude oil and, fearing its closure, Ottawa - which has warned a shutdown would have a profound impact on both sides of the border, including on jobs and supply chains - backed Enbridge's legal case. It invoked the 1977 Transit Pipelines Treaty between the two countries.The treaty ensures that crude oil will flow between the US and Canada so long as the pipelines involved are compliant with various rules and regulations. It forces an arbitration process in the event of a dispute.But Michigan has the support of 12 federally recognised Anishinaabe tribes in the state, who say Line 5 poses too high a risk to the Great Lakes.The waters are also of spiritual importance for the tribes, who argue they are protected by their constitutional treaty rights.  \"The Straits of Mackinac are the centre of our creation story,\" explains the President of the Bay Mills Indian Community, Whitney Gravelle. She said they have a right to hunt, fish and gather in the territory \"in perpetuity - and Line 5 is a ticking time bomb that could destroy our culture and lifeways\".For many Michiganders it is a vital fuel supply - their main source of heating, delivering 55% of the state's propane needs, according to Enbridge.Dan Harrington is the owner of UP Propane, a major supplier of propane used for heating in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, north of the Straits of Mackinac.  Over concerns the pipeline would be shut down, he arranged an alternative supply route so as not to let down his 17,000 customers. \"We actually put in a rail terminal where we aren't getting any, or very little, of our propane from Line 5,\" says Harrington.  But if it were shut down, \"the Midwest would be in a world of hurt\",  he said. While Enbridge says the Great Lakes tunnel project would \"virtually eliminate\" the chance of a spill, others disagree. An independent pipeline safety expert hired by the Bay Mills Indian Community, Richard Kuprewicz, says that transporting oil and gas \"through an enclosed tunnel enhances the risk of a catastrophic explosion\" - a risk he called low but not \"negligible\". If there was a pipeline break, even in the best-case scenario the outcome would be disastrous, according to Great Lakes oceanographer Dave Schwab.  Line 5 carries almost half-a-million gallons of oil and natural gas daily.  \"So even if the oil flow was stopped instantly, which is impossible, the pipe would still contain a minimum of 5,000 barrels of oil,\" he said.  A \"best-case scenario\" could see 700km (435 miles) of shoreline along Lake Huron and Lake Michigan affected, he said, and \"in the worst case of a 25,000 barrel spill, over 1,000km of shoreline in both Canada and America would be affected\".According to an independent risk analysis commissioned by Michigan, an oil spill could cost almost $2bn in damages. Given the diversity of habitats in and around the Straits - home to many insects, fish and migratory birds - it may \"represent a point of no return for species loss\".  Michigan has been looking at options to replace Line 5 that include adding pumping stations to increase the flow of other Enbridge pipelines, or transporting the product via trucks and railroads. Those options, Canada's Minister for Natural Resources Jonathan Wilkinson told the BBC, were \"less safe, less efficient, and higher emitting\".Pipelines are generally regarded as a safe way to transport fuel and a better alternative to tanker trucks or freight trains. Supporters argue Line 5 is critical to the state for the millions of dollars Enbridge pays in property, corporate and other tax revenues annually, and is vital to its energy needs. Enbridge says there's no viable alternative to the tunnel project and that they intend to continue operating Line 5 at the Straits until the tunnel's completion. \"The tunnel makes what has always been a safe pipeline even safer, ensuring energy access and reliability, and supporting jobs and the economy throughout the Great Lakes Region,\" it told the BBC in an emailed statement. They said they had also taken additional measures to regularly monitor its integrity and prevent future anchor strikes. Although Line 5 has spilled over one million gallons at other stretches of the pipeline over its lifetime, Enbridge states that the portion crossing Mackinac \"remains in excellent condition and has never experienced a leak\".  So far, the Biden administration has kept at arm's length from the dispute, saying it will allow current environmental reviews of the tunnel project to play out. But Heather Exner-Pirot, a Senior Fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a Canadian think-tank, believes Mr Biden is unlikely to allow Line 5 to close, especially in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has had a significant impact on global energy supply and markets.\"The energy crisis has caused the political tides to turn on this,\" said Ms Pirot.This will dismay both environmentalists and tribes, who assert that Line 5 is contrary to the Biden administration's green energy commitments. \"Enbridge is speaking the universal language of economics,\" says Liz Kirkwood of FLOW, a non-profit conservation group, referring to the firm's warnings that a shutdown would have immediate consequences on the economies in the region.\"What we're talking about is 20% of the planet's fresh surface water and the identity of an entire region.

They said they had also taken additional measures to regularly monitor its integrity and prevent future anchor strikes. Although Line 5 has spilled over one million gallons at other stretches of the pipeline over its lifetime, Enbridge states that the portion crossing Mackinac \"remains in excellent condition and has never experienced a leak\".  So far, the Biden administration has kept at arm's length from the dispute, saying it will allow current environmental reviews of the tunnel project to play out. But Heather Exner-Pirot, a Senior Fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a Canadian think-tank, believes Mr Biden is unlikely to allow Line 5 to close, especially in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has had a significant impact on global energy supply and markets.\"The energy crisis has caused the political tides to turn on this,\" said Ms Pirot.This will dismay both environmentalists and tribes, who assert that Line 5 is contrary to the Biden administration's green energy commitments. \"Enbridge is speaking the universal language of economics,\" says Liz Kirkwood of FLOW, a non-profit conservation group, referring to the firm's warnings that a shutdown would have immediate consequences on the economies in the region.\"What we're talking about is 20% of the planet's fresh surface water and the identity of an entire region.

      " the p tags is: For more than a century the scramble for oil unleashed wars, forced unusual alliances and sparked diplomatic rows. Now the world's two biggest economies are battling over another precious resource: semiconductors, the chips that literally power our daily life.These tiny fragments of silicon are at the heart of a $500bn industry that is expected to double by 2030. And whoever controls the supply chains - a tangled network of companies and countries that make the chips - holds the key to being an unrivalled superpower.China wants the technology to produce chips. That's why the US, a source of much of the tech, is cutting Beijing off. The two countries are clearly engaged in an arms race in the Asia Pacific, says Chris Miller, author of Chip Wars and associate professor at Tufts University. But, he adds, there's more to the race: \"[It] takes place both in traditional spheres, like numbers of ships, or missiles produced but increasingly, it's taking place in terms of the quality of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms that can be employed in military systems.\" For now, the US is winning - but the chip war it has declared on China is reshaping the global economy. The manufacture of semiconductors is complex, specialist and deeply integrated. An iPhone has chips that are designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, then assembled in China. India, which is investing more in the industry, could play a bigger role in the future. Semiconductors were invented in the US, but over time East Asia emerged as a manufacturing hub, largely because of government incentives, including subsidies. This allowed Washington to develop business ties and strategic alliances in a region vulnerable to Russian influence during the Cold War. It's just as useful now, in the face of Beijing's growing influence in the Asia Pacific.The race is on to make the best and most efficient chips at scale - and the smaller, the better. The challenge: how many transistors - tiny electrical switches that can turn a current on or off - can you fit onto the smallest bit of a silicon wafer?\"It's what the semiconductor industry calls Moore's law, essentially doubling the transistor density over time, and that's a hard goal to achieve,\" said Jue Wang, a partner at Silicon Valley at Bain & Company.\"It's what enables our phones to get faster, our digital photo archive to get bigger, our smart home devices to get smarter over time and our social media content to get richer.\" Getting there is not easy even for the top chip-makers. In mid-2022, Samsung became the first company to start mass producing three-nanometre chips at scale. Later that year, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) - the world's biggest chip-maker and a major supplier to Apple - followed. How narrow is that? Much narrower than a strand of human hair, which is about 50 to 100,000 nanometres. These smaller \"leading edge\" chips are more powerful, which means they go into more valuable devices - supercomputers and AI, the internet of things. The market for \"lagging edge\" chips - which power the more mundane bits of our lives, such as microwaves, washing machines and refrigerators - is lucrative too. But demand will likely wither in the future. Most of the world's chips are currently being made in Taiwan, giving the self-ruled island what its President calls a \"silicon shield\" - in other words, protection from China, which claims the territory. Beijing too has made chip production a national priority and is investing aggressively in supercomputers and AI. It is nowhere near being a global leader but has been catching up quickly in the past decade, especially in its chip design capabilities, Mr Miller says. \"What you find historically is that whenever powerful countries have advanced computing technology, they deploy them to intelligence and military systems,\" he added.This, and the dependence on Taiwan and other Asian countries for supply, is rattling America. The Biden administration is trying to choke China's access to the technology that makes chips.Last October, Washington announced sweeping export controls making it virtually impossible for companies to sell chips, chip-making equipment, and software containing US tech to China, no matter where they are based in the world. It also banned US citizens and permanent residents from supporting the \"development or production\" of chips at certain factories in China. This hits China hard because it imports both the hardware and the talent that fuels its nascent chip-making industry. The Netherlands' ASML stands to lose about a quarter of the revenue it used to earn from China. It's the only company that makes the most advanced lithographic machines - the tools that make \"leading edge\" chips. \"Talent is so important in this area... if you look at the executives of China's semiconductor companies, a lot of them hold American passports, they are trained in the US, and they have green cards. So that is a really big problem for China,\" says Linghao Bao, analyst at policy research firm Trivium China. The US also wants to make more chips. The Chips and Science Act offers $53bn of grants and subsidies to companies making semiconductors in the US. Major players are taking advantage of that. TSMC is investing in two plants worth $40 billion in the US, their only facilities outside of Taiwan. Micron, the largest US-based manufacturer of memory chips - essential for supercomputers, military hardware and any device that has a processor - has announced plans to spend up to $100bn over the next 20 years in a computer chip plant in upstate New York.\"The Chips Act is able to bridge the cost gap that exists in production in the US versus Asia,\" says Sanjay Mehrotra, the chief executive of Micron Technology. \"Micron will continue to invest in our fabs [plants] in Asia. What is important is that there'll be a level playing field across the globe.\"The US's restrictions are hitting China where it hurts. Apple reportedly shelved a deal to buy memory chips from one of China's most successful chip companies, Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp (YMTC), in the wake of the restrictions.The Huawei experience is how this is likely to play out, according to Mr Bao. The communications giant went from being the second-largest smartphone maker in the world, after Samsung, to \"essentially dead\", Mr Bao says.\"So that's how easy it was for Washington to cripple a Chinese tech company. China doesn't really have a good option to respond to that. Previously, the US was targeting individual Chinese companies. But this time, the scope has expanded to the entire country.\"Can China do anything in response? Withdrawing goods or services, or imposing its own export controls, could do more damage than good at a time when its economy is facing a severe slowdown.Beijing has complained to the World Trade Organization (WTO) but a resolution could take years.Meanwhile, experts say, China will double down on investment and support for its domestic chip-making industry.\"We will focus national strategic needs, gather strength to carry out indigenous and leading scientific and technological research, and resolutely win the battle in key core technologies,\" President Xi Jinping said at the Chinese Communist Party's 20th Congress in October.In the short term, the industry has to contend with a global slowdown because of the war in Ukraine, rising inflation and a bumpy re-opening of China's economy. Beijing will want to tread carefully given that its economy took a huge hit through the Covid pandemic.\"There will still be a lot of back and forth between US companies, Taiwanese companies, Chinese companies and firms from other countries. It's really only at the cutting edge in logic and memory chips, where we're going to see a concerted effort by the US to cut China out of innovation networks and an effort by China to build up its own US-free supply chain,\" Mr Miller said.He adds that could mean a partial decoupling of the ecosystem - one focused on China and one on the rest of the world.That has huge ramifications for the global economy. It will force players to pick sides, possibly cutting many off from accessing the Chinese market.

China doesn't really have a good option to respond to that. Previously, the US was targeting individual Chinese companies. But this time, the scope has expanded to the entire country.\"Can China do anything in response? Withdrawing goods or services, or imposing its own export controls, could do more damage than good at a time when its economy is facing a severe slowdown.Beijing has complained to the World Trade Organization (WTO) but a resolution could take years.Meanwhile, experts say, China will double down on investment and support for its domestic chip-making industry.\"We will focus national strategic needs, gather strength to carry out indigenous and leading scientific and technological research, and resolutely win the battle in key core technologies,\" President Xi Jinping said at the Chinese Communist Party's 20th Congress in October.In the short term, the industry has to contend with a global slowdown because of the war in Ukraine, rising inflation and a bumpy re-opening of China's economy. Beijing will want to tread carefully given that its economy took a huge hit through the Covid pandemic.\"There will still be a lot of back and forth between US companies, Taiwanese companies, Chinese companies and firms from other countries. It's really only at the cutting edge in logic and memory chips, where we're going to see a concerted effort by the US to cut China out of innovation networks and an effort by China to build up its own US-free supply chain,\" Mr Miller said.He adds that could mean a partial decoupling of the ecosystem - one focused on China and one on the rest of the world.That has huge ramifications for the global economy. It will force players to pick sides, possibly cutting many off from accessing the Chinese market.

      " the p tags is: Job losses are \"inevitable\" if Nexperia is forced to sell its controlling stake in the UK's largest microchip factory, the company has said.Newport Wafer Fab, which employs more than 500 people, was bought out by the subsidiary of Shanghai's Wingtech in July 2021. It is worried about the potential influence of the Chinese government.The business's UK operations chief, Tony Versluijs, insisted there was \"no risk whatsoever\".\"We are genuinely shocked by this decision,\" he said.\"We believe it's the wrong decision and we'll look to get it overturned.\"It was, he said, wrong for the UK's semiconductor industry and for the taxpayer.\"Any other owner would have a hell of a job keeping the same level of jobs over here,\" Mr Versluijs said. \"That would mean that redundancies would be inevitable.\"The microchips made at Newport Wafer Fab, called semiconductors, let electricity flow through devices, and are key to smartphones, laptops and other tech.UK and US politicians had concerns about Nexperia's acquisition of the site before the sale.Cybersecurity expert Dominique Lazanski said that stemmed from how China could exploit control of the company.\"Most Chinese companies, 99.9% of them, have some sort of influence into them from the Chinese Communist Party,\" she said.Industries had to seek approval for activities and investments through the Communist Party, she said. \"When a Chinese company or a subsidiary goes and tries to buy a company that makes specific technology and holds specific intellectual property, that's a concern,\" she said.\"They have access effectively to the UK, to investment, to potentially what the government is doing and more importantly to research\".The UK government said its concerns centred around the threat of \"undermining UK capabilities\" in making semiconductors.It claimed the site's location in the semiconductor cluster on the Duffryn industrial estate in Newport could \"facilitate access to technological expertise and know-how\".Mr Versluijs dismissed those concerns about national security as hypothetical.He said: \"The decision is not about what is actually happening at this site.

Gloves, a white suit and hood need to be put on in the right order before stepping into a chamber where jets of air blast away remaining contaminants.The process, a guide explains, is not to protect people, but the product.

Nexperia is headquartered in the Netherlands but its ultimate owners are Chinese firm Wingtech Technology.And that set off alarm bells.\"It's not in the strategic interest of the United Kingdom, the United States or any other allies that China gains prominence in the global semiconductor industry,\" says Martijn Rasser, a former CIA analyst and now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank.Semi-conductors are one crucial area in technology where China has struggled. Washington has taken advantage of this by restricting supplies to the Chinese telecoms company Huawei, causing it considerable pain. China is desperate to catch up and reduce its dependency.That means the UK selling its largest facility to a company with Chinese ownership has met with resistance. Washington, especially Congress, will \"lean heavily\" to prevent the acquisition from being concluded says Mr Rasser.But alarm bells did not initially seem to ring loud within the UK government. The National Security Adviser carried out a review whose conclusions remain unclear. It was only this May, close to a year after the sale and after heaving lobbying, that ministers ordered a national security review under new powers. This is due imminently (unless there is an extension) and could force the unwinding of the purchase.The issues are thorny though.The national security concerns are not about highly sensitive technology being made at the site with a defence or intelligence role. Rather it is about not having to rely on chips made overseas.\"We do need to build up our own domestic resilience as the US is doing, as the European Union is doing, as indeed many other countries around the world [are] trying to do,\" argues Tom Tugendhat, Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee who has campaigned against the sale. \"But in order to do it, we need to have the building blocks. Newport Wafer Fab is one of those building blocks.\"The Newport facility does not make the most advanced semi-conductors.

Semiconductors are sometimes referred to as the \"brains\" of electronics like smartphones, car components and AI technology. Mark Liu, TSMC's chairman, said the firm would build two semiconductor fabrication plants with the first one expected to be online by 2024. The overall investment will be approximately $40bn. It is the largest investment the company has made outside of Taiwan.   The investment is a boost for Mr Biden following supply chain disruption that has led to chip shortages and amid growing tensions between the US and China. The original deal for TSMC to build a plant in the US came in 2020 when President Donald Trump was in office. The latest announcement vastly increases the size of that investment.\"Today, we're down to producing only around 10 percent of the world's chips, despite leading the world in research and design in new chip technologies,\" said Mr Biden during a speech in Phoenix on Tuesday. The US once made more than 30% of the world's computer chips before the jobs moved overseas, he said. \"The United States is better positioned than any other nation to lead the world economy in the years ahead if we keep our focus,\" he added. The opening ceremony was attended by several heads of technology companies that rely on TSMC production, such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook said it was a significant moment.  \"We look forward to expanding this work in the years to come as TSMC forms new and deeper roots in America,\" he said.Analysts see TSMC's investment as a potential game changer in the industry.\"The TSMC investment is a significant step for US chip investment over the next decade,\" according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. \"This kicks off a legitimate battle between the US and China on chip production with this being a monumental strategic move by TSMC\".  In August, President Biden signed a law committing $280bn (Â£232bn) to high tech manufacturing and scientific research amid fears that the US was losing its technological edge to China. The investments include tax breaks for companies that build computer chip manufacturing plants in the US.The move came at a time when relations between the two countries have soured. This has been fuelled by Beijing's claims over self-ruled Taiwan and its increasing assertiveness in Asia.

      " the p tags is: When Edison Davis and Augustine Nemus set out to fish from India's southern coast on 27 November, they promised their families they would be home for Christmas. Then, there was no word from them for weeks.The two men were part of a group of 15 fishermen who set sail in a deep-sea vessel for close to three weeks to fish in the Arabian Sea. The men's families didn't panic at first; they were used to the fishermen spending days at sea. They wondered if something similar had happened to their family members. But the fishermen returned home on 2 January. Their boat's engine had suffered a snag and the fishermen ended up marooned on a remote island in British Indian Ocean territory for days, until they were finally rescued by a passing British vessel. With no idea when they were going to be rescued, the fishermen had found innovative ways to survive, including by drinking water from coconuts found on the island.The fishermen had sailed in a wooden boat called Chrisha Mol from Thengapattanam harbour in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. But on the seventh day, the boat's engine broke down and the vessel began drifting deeper into the sea. This continued for five days, until a Sri Lankan boat showed up. \"The crew pulled our boat to a place where the water was around 8m (26ft) deep. We thought we were safe and we dropped anchor there,\" Mr Nemus told the BBC.Since Sri Lankan fishing vessels are not allowed to enter Indian waters, the crew advised the fishermen to send wireless messages seeking help from Indian fishing boats in the region.Three days later, a boat responded. Unfortunately, its engine wasn't powerful enough to tow the heavier Chrisha Mol to shore. Chrisha Mol's owner, who was part of the group, took the boat's gearbox and left with the Indian boat to get it fixed after reaching the shore. The crew also left behind their anchor so that the fishermen could firmly tether their boat and prevent it from drifting. But on 19 December, a sudden gust of wind caused the rope of one of the boat's anchors to snap. Three days later the rope of the second one snapped too, and the boat began drifting again.\"We could only pray to God in the middle of the sea. We didn't know where it was taking us,\" Mr Nemus said. \"I thought of my wife and two teenage sons.\" The crew checked the navigation device on board. \"The GPS showed us that there was an island 29 nautical miles away,\" Mr Davis said. It was located on Salomon Islands in the British Indian Ocean.Nine fishermen then got into a dinghy - a small boat they had towed along - loaded it with rice and other provisions and headed towards the island, Mr Davis said.Two fishermen then returned to fetch the five crew members who had waited back on the boat, but by then, the boat had drifted further away. \"We found the boat after searching for it for over an hour,\" Mr Davis said.It took the seven fishermen about five hours to reach the small island, which Mr Davis says was uninhabited. Now they faced a new challenge: how were they going to survive with their supplies close to running out?They had just enough food to last them 10 days and no potable water to drink.So, the fishermen turned to nature for help. They used sea water to cook. When they were thirsty, they foraged for coconuts and drank their water. When it rained, they spread out plastic sheets on the ground, collected the droplets and stored the water in cans.\"I felt like we were face-to-face with death. We were not sleeping properly and we cooked and ate sparingly,\" Mr Nemus said.\"We feared our provisions would run out anytime. We had no idea where we were and how long we would remain stranded there.\"After five days, on 27 December, they saw a British ship some distance away from the island. The ecstatic fishermen tied a bright red cloth to the branch of a tree and began signalling for help.\"We tried to attract the ship's attention in all possible ways. Two hours later, four crew members approached us with water and a basket of fruits. They asked if we were okay,\" Mr Davis said. Then, they took the fishermen to the ship in a dinghy.  Onboard the ship, the fishermen had a shower for the first time in days. The crew checked their health, served them food and gave them clothes to change into.On 2 January, the ship handed the fishermen over to the Indian coastguard at Vizhinjam port on the southern Indian coast.

      "When Edison Davis and Augustine Nemus set out to fish from India's southern coast on 27 November, they promised their families they would be home for Christmas. Then, there was no word from them for weeks.The two men were part of a group of 15 fishermen who set sail in a deep-sea vessel for close to three weeks to fish in the Arabian Sea. The men's families didn't panic at first; they were used to the fishermen spending days at sea. They wondered if something similar had happened to their family members. But the fishermen returned home on 2 January. Their boat's engine had suffered a snag and the fishermen ended up marooned on a remote island in British Indian Ocean territory for days, until they were finally rescued by a passing British vessel. With no idea when they were going to be rescued, the fishermen had found innovative ways to survive, including by drinking water from coconuts found on the island.The fishermen had sailed in a wooden boat called Chrisha Mol from Thengapattanam harbour in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. But on the seventh day, the boat's engine broke down and the vessel began drifting deeper into the sea. This continued for five days, until a Sri Lankan boat showed up. \"The crew pulled our boat to a place where the water was around 8m (26ft) deep. We thought we were safe and we dropped anchor there,\" Mr Nemus told the BBC.Since Sri Lankan fishing vessels are not allowed to enter Indian waters, the crew advised the fishermen to send wireless messages seeking help from Indian fishing boats in the region.Three days later, a boat responded.

But one isotope, tritium, cannot be removed so the water has been stored in huge tanks which will fill up by 2022. On Friday Japan's industry minister Hiroshi Kajiyama said no decision had yet been made on the disposal of the water but the government planned to make one soon.\"To prevent any delays in the decommissioning process, we need to make a decision quickly,\" he told a news conference.Environmental groups have long expressed their opposition to releasing the water into the ocean. And fishing groups have argued against it, saying consumers will refuse to buy produce from the region.However some scientists say the water would quickly be diluted in the vastness of the Pacific Ocean, and that tritium poses a low risk to human and animal health. On 11 March 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the north-eastern coast of Japan, triggering a 15-metre tsunami.While the back-up systems to prevent a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant survived the initial quake, further damage was inflicted by the tsunami.As the facility's cooling systems failed in the days that followed, tonnes of radioactive material were released. The meltdown was the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986.Around 18,500 people died or disappeared in the quake and tsunami, and more than 160,000 were forced from their homes.This video can not be playedFukushima: How to move a mountain of radioactive soilBillions of dollars in compensation have already been paid to individuals and businesses affected by the disaster.

On Friday Japan's industry minister Hiroshi Kajiyama said no decision had yet been made on the disposal of the water but the government planned to make one soon.\"To prevent any delays in the decommissioning process, we need to make a decision quickly,\" he told a news conference.Environmental groups have long expressed their opposition to releasing the water into the ocean. And fishing groups have argued against it, saying consumers will refuse to buy produce from the region.However some scientists say the water would quickly be diluted in the vastness of the Pacific Ocean, and that tritium poses a low risk to human and animal health. On 11 March 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the north-eastern coast of Japan, triggering a 15-metre tsunami.While the back-up systems to prevent a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant survived the initial quake, further damage was inflicted by the tsunami.As the facility's cooling systems failed in the days that followed, tonnes of radioactive material were released. The meltdown was the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986.Around 18,500 people died or disappeared in the quake and tsunami, and more than 160,000 were forced from their homes.This video can not be playedFukushima: How to move a mountain of radioactive soilBillions of dollars in compensation have already been paid to individuals and businesses affected by the disaster.

      " the p tags is: It's 10 years since smoking was banned in enclosed workplaces in England, following similar moves in the rest of the UK. But how has the \"pub smoking ban\" changed the country?Do you remember the time when pubs were full of smoke? When you could light up after a meal at a restaurant? Or when smokers didn't have to congregate on the street outside offices?The law, which marked a fundamental shift in attitudes towards smoking, is now 10 years old. It banned smoking in all enclosed public places and work places when it came into force in England on 1 July 2007. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales had already taken the plunge over the previous 18 months.Its backers justified it on the basis that smokers were putting others at risk by exposing them to second-hand smoke. But opponents suggested the risks from passive smoking did not justify the attack on smoking.At the time the move was controversial. The health lobby fought for decades to get it introduced and right up until the last minute ministers considered all sorts of exceptions - retaining smoking rooms or allowing certain premises to be exempt.But once introduced, the country soon fell into line. Councils were charged with policing it. In the first 18 months officers inspected nearly 600,000 premises. Few broke the rules.Public backing grew and grew - and remains strong today. A poll of more than 4,000 adults by YouGov released for the 10th anniversary found nearly three-quarters of people would oppose the ban being overturned, with just 12% wanting to get rid of it. But other polling does show opinion is pretty split on whether the complete ban could be modified - such as by the introduction of designated smoking rooms in pubs and clubs.The number of pubs in the UK has been falling.  Between 2007 and 2015, the UK lost nearly 7,000 pubs.  Some publicans and other critics say the smoking ban played a large part in this. Simon Clark, of the smokers' rights lobby group Forest, says the impact has been \"devastating\".The British Beer and Pub Association cites the rise in the tax applied to drinks - and beer in particular. The beer duty escalator meant that between 2008 and 2013 the duty increased by 42% and this has come at a time when supermarkets have tried to entice shoppers in with discounts on booze.With all these factors happening at the same time, BBPA spokesman Neil Williams says it is \"pretty impossible\" to unpick exactly what the individual impact of the ban has been. And of course, many pubs have thrived since the smoking ban, changing to focus more on high-quality food and trying to attract families - including those with young children - who would previously have avoided smoky atmospheres. \"Pubs have had to adapt. We've seen those that can invest in food and they've made a very good job of it. \"But some pubs - the traditional street-corner boozer - simply haven't had the space to do that. They are the ones that have suffered.\"And there's a wider picture. People in the UK seem to be drinking less. Smoking rates are falling. Today fewer than 17% of people smoke. But as the graph below shows the downward trend goes back decades - and there was actually a slowing of the rate of decline immediately after the ban.Most experts agree that is understandable. As the numbers fall, what you are left with is a more hardcore group of smokers whom it is hard to persuade to give up.But how much of the fall is down to the ban - and how much is down to other factors?There are fewer young people taking up smoking. The numbers have halved since the introduction of the ban.But again it is difficult to work out quite how much of that is down to the 2007 legislation. When you look at drinking rates, drug use or teenage pregnancy numbers, they tell a similar story. There is a clear pattern - the young have changed the way they behave. This consistent trend has not yet been properly explained. One of the few convincing theories centres on social media - the idea is that young people spend so much of their time online that it has replaced other vices. The ban also encouraged some existing smokers to give up. Following its introduction there was a 23% increase in quit attempts made via NHS stop-smoking services.Research suggests the ban was particularly effective at raising awareness about the risks of second-hand smoke - people were motivated to protect those they smoked around, as well as looking after their own health.The YouGov poll also provides some evidence. It found 14% of ex-smokers had been influenced in their decision to quit by the ban, while 20% of current smokers say they smoke less because of it.But you can't ignore the influence of e-cigarettes either. Vaping has offered a healthier, more socially acceptable alternative to smoking.Momentum was just gathering in 2007, but figures from the Office for National Statistics show that today one in 20 people over 16 regularly uses e-cigarettes - a quarter of them are smokers or ex-smokers.But not every measure shows such positive results. England still has a relatively large number of women who smoke during pregnancy - one in 10 at last count , although the figures are admittedly falling.Policymakers have been so worried about these numbers that they have tried offering financial incentives, such as shopping vouchers, to pregnant women who quit.There also remains a large discrepancy in the income levels between who smokes and who doesn't. Those with the lowest incomes are twice as likely to smoke as people who come from the highest income groups - a gap that refuses to budge even as smoking rates fall. Tackling this discrepancy has been a major focus of health campaigners in recent years. Smoking rates are a significant factor in the differences in life expectancy and health outcomes.Talking of health, how has the ban affected the rates of illness and disease? In the years after the ban there was a flurry of research looking at what impact it had had.The Department of Health commissioned an evidence review that was published in 2011. It highlighted a fall in respiratory illness reported by bar workers immediately after the ban.The review also flagged up research that showed hospital admissions for heart attacks fell by 2.4% immediately following the change in the law. That was the equivalent of 1,200 heart attacks a year.Cancer Research UK chief executive Sir Harpal Kumar believes the impact on health will continue to be \"huge\" and that the ban should be viewed as one of the most important public health measures of recent history. But truly assessing the impact on health will take some time. Overall hospital admissions and deaths attributable to smoking have been falling in recent years, but only slowly.The fact remains that it takes some time for the impact of lower smoking rates to influence health outcomes.Take lung cancer, for example. About 85% of cases are caused by smoking. But if you look at the number of cases being diagnosed, the figures for men and women were going in the opposite direction until 2012.The rising rates in women seen after 2007 are not, of course, because the ban had opposite effects on men and women. Instead it is to do with what was happening half a century ago, because of the long lag between smoking and cancer developing.It was not until the mid 1960s that the numbers of women smoking eventually peaked. For men that happened at the end of World War Two, hence lung cancer cases have been falling for over 20 years in men.But one thing we can see clearly 10 years on is how the global appetite for anti-smoking legislation has grown. While the UK took its time in introducing the ban, since then ministers have proved to be more decisive.When the legislation was introduced, England was following the herd. The Republic of Ireland was the first country to introduce a complete ban in 2004. A host of other countries from the US and Canada to Australia had taken their own steps too by 2007. But others have quickly followed suit and now smoking bans - whether full or partial - are commonplace as this chart (which is by no means exhaustive) shows.Over the past decade there has been a flurry of new legislation - and the UK has often been at the forefront. The age at which people can buy tobacco products has been raised from 16 to 18 and they are no longer stocked in vending machines. Bans of tobacco displays in shops have also been introduced, while cigarettes now have to be sold in standardised packages and smoking is not allowed in cars carrying children.

      " the title tag is: Pub smoking ban: 10 charts that show the impact - BBC News\n",
      "It's 10 years since smoking was banned in enclosed workplaces in England, following similar moves in the rest of the UK. But how has the \"pub smoking ban\" changed the country?Do you remember the time when pubs were full of smoke? When you could light up after a meal at a restaurant? Or when smokers didn't have to congregate on the street outside offices?The law, which marked a fundamental shift in attitudes towards smoking, is now 10 years old. It banned smoking in all enclosed public places and work places when it came into force in England on 1 July 2007. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales had already taken the plunge over the previous 18 months.Its backers justified it on the basis that smokers were putting others at risk by exposing them to second-hand smoke. But opponents suggested the risks from passive smoking did not justify the attack on smoking.At the time the move was controversial. The health lobby fought for decades to get it introduced and right up until the last minute ministers considered all sorts of exceptions - retaining smoking rooms or allowing certain premises to be exempt.But once introduced, the country soon fell into line. Councils were charged with policing it. In the first 18 months officers inspected nearly 600,000 premises. Few broke the rules.Public backing grew and grew - and remains strong today. A poll of more than 4,000 adults by YouGov released for the 10th anniversary found nearly three-quarters of people would oppose the ban being overturned, with just 12% wanting to get rid of it. But other polling does show opinion is pretty split on whether the complete ban could be modified - such as by the introduction of designated smoking rooms in pubs and clubs.The number of pubs in the UK has been falling.  Between 2007 and 2015, the UK lost nearly 7,000 pubs.  Some publicans and other critics say the smoking ban played a large part in this. Simon Clark, of the smokers' rights lobby group Forest, says the impact has been \"devastating\".The British Beer and Pub Association cites the rise in the tax applied to drinks - and beer in particular. The beer duty escalator meant that between 2008 and 2013 the duty increased by 42% and this has come at a time when supermarkets have tried to entice shoppers in with discounts on booze.With all these factors happening at the same time, BBPA spokesman Neil Williams says it is \"pretty impossible\" to unpick exactly what the individual impact of the ban has been. And of course, many pubs have thrived since the smoking ban, changing to focus more on high-quality food and trying to attract families - including those with young children - who would previously have avoided smoky atmospheres. \"Pubs have had to adapt. We've seen those that can invest in food and they've made a very good job of it. \"But some pubs - the traditional street-corner boozer - simply haven't had the space to do that. They are the ones that have suffered.\"And there's a wider picture. People in the UK seem to be drinking less. Smoking rates are falling. Today fewer than 17% of people smoke. But as the graph below shows the downward trend goes back decades - and there was actually a slowing of the rate of decline immediately after the ban.Most experts agree that is understandable. As the numbers fall, what you are left with is a more hardcore group of smokers whom it is hard to persuade to give up.But how much of the fall is down to the ban - and how much is down to other factors?There are fewer young people taking up smoking. The numbers have halved since the introduction of the ban.But again it is difficult to work out quite how much of that is down to the 2007 legislation. When you look at drinking rates, drug use or teenage pregnancy numbers, they tell a similar story. There is a clear pattern - the young have changed the way they behave. This consistent trend has not yet been properly explained. One of the few convincing theories centres on social media - the idea is that young people spend so much of their time online that it has replaced other vices. The ban also encouraged some existing smokers to give up. Following its introduction there was a 23% increase in quit attempts made via NHS stop-smoking services.Research suggests the ban was particularly effective at raising awareness about the risks of second-hand smoke - people were motivated to protect those they smoked around, as well as looking after their own health.The YouGov poll also provides some evidence. It found 14% of ex-smokers had been influenced in their decision to quit by the ban, while 20% of current smokers say they smoke less because of it.But you can't ignore the influence of e-cigarettes either. Vaping has offered a healthier, more socially acceptable alternative to smoking.Momentum was just gathering in 2007, but figures from the Office for National Statistics show that today one in 20 people over 16 regularly uses e-cigarettes - a quarter of them are smokers or ex-smokers.But not every measure shows such positive results. England still has a relatively large number of women who smoke during pregnancy - one in 10 at last count , although the figures are admittedly falling.Policymakers have been so worried about these numbers that they have tried offering financial incentives, such as shopping vouchers, to pregnant women who quit.There also remains a large discrepancy in the income levels between who smokes and who doesn't. Those with the lowest incomes are twice as likely to smoke as people who come from the highest income groups - a gap that refuses to budge even as smoking rates fall. Tackling this discrepancy has been a major focus of health campaigners in recent years. Smoking rates are a significant factor in the differences in life expectancy and health outcomes.Talking of health, how has the ban affected the rates of illness and disease? In the years after the ban there was a flurry of research looking at what impact it had had.The Department of Health commissioned an evidence review that was published in 2011. It highlighted a fall in respiratory illness reported by bar workers immediately after the ban.The review also flagged up research that showed hospital admissions for heart attacks fell by 2.4% immediately following the change in the law. That was the equivalent of 1,200 heart attacks a year.Cancer Research UK chief executive Sir Harpal Kumar believes the impact on health will continue to be \"huge\" and that the ban should be viewed as one of the most important public health measures of recent history. But truly assessing the impact on health will take some time. Overall hospital admissions and deaths attributable to smoking have been falling in recent years, but only slowly.The fact remains that it takes some time for the impact of lower smoking rates to influence health outcomes.Take lung cancer, for example. About 85% of cases are caused by smoking. But if you look at the number of cases being diagnosed, the figures for men and women were going in the opposite direction until 2012.The rising rates in women seen after 2007 are not, of course, because the ban had opposite effects on men and women. Instead it is to do with what was happening half a century ago, because of the long lag between smoking and cancer developing.It was not until the mid 1960s that the numbers of women smoking eventually peaked.

      " the p tags is: The family of a British-Iranian dual national sentenced to death in Iran have told BBC Persian that authorities are preparing to execute him.Alireza Akbari's wife, Maryam, said the family had been asked to go to his prison for a \"final visit\" and that he had been moved to solitary confinement.The ex-deputy Iranian defence minister was arrested in 2019 and convicted of spying for the UK, which he denied.The UK urged Iran to halt the planned execution and immediately release him. Earlier, a Foreign Office spokesperson told the BBC that it was supporting Mr Akbari's family and had repeatedly raised his case with Iranian authorities. It has requested urgent consular access, but Iran's government does not recognise dual nationality for Iranians.BBC Persian also broadcast an audio message on Wednesday from Mr Akbari in which he says he was tortured and forced to confess on camera to crimes he did not commit. He says that he was living abroad a few years ago when he was invited to visit Iran at the request of a top Iranian diplomat who was involved in nuclear talks with world powers.Once there, he adds, he was accused of obtaining top secret intelligence from the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, \"in exchange for a bottle of perfume and a shirt\".Mr Akbari served under Mr Shamkhani when the latter was defence minister during the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, a reformist who was in office for two terms between 1997 and 2005.Mr Akbari alleges in the audio message that he was \"interrogated and tortured\" by intelligence agents \"for more than 3,500 hours\". \"During all those 3,500 hours, which took more than 10 months, they were recording my confessions with 10 cameras to make their Hollywood-style film,\" he says, adding that he was also given \"psychedelic drugs\".\"By using physiological and psychological methods, they broke my will, drove me to madness and forced me to do whatever they wanted. By the force of gun and death threats they made me confess to false and corrupt claims.\"He also accuses Iran of seeking \"to take revenge on the UK by executing me\".Hours after the audio message was broadcast, the Iranian judiciary's Mizan news agency confirmed for the first time that Mr Akbari had been found guilty of espionage, and that the Supreme Court had rejected his appeal.It cited Iran's intelligence ministry as saying that Mr Akbari had been \"one of the most important infiltrators of the country's sensitive and strategic centres\" for the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, better known as MI6, and that he had been \"compiling and consciously transferring sensitive information\".  The ministry claimed that its agents uncovered Mr Akbari's spying by feeding him false information.At the end of November, Iranian state media reported that authorities had hanged four men convicted of \"co-operating\" with Israeli intelligence.Four other men have been executed since December after being sentenced to death in connection with the anti-government protests engulfing the country.Alicia Kearns, chair of the UK House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, said the news from Mr Akbari's family was \"awful\". She speculated that Mr Akbari might have been singled out by hard-liners in the establishment in order to undermine Mr Shamkhani, who she described as a \"moderate voice...

      " the title tag is: Alireza Akbari: Iran preparing to execute British citizen - family - BBC News\n",
      "The family of a British-Iranian dual national sentenced to death in Iran have told BBC Persian that authorities are preparing to execute him.Alireza Akbari's wife, Maryam, said the family had been asked to go to his prison for a \"final visit\" and that he had been moved to solitary confinement.The ex-deputy Iranian defence minister was arrested in 2019 and convicted of spying for the UK, which he denied.The UK urged Iran to halt the planned execution and immediately release him. Earlier, a Foreign Office spokesperson told the BBC that it was supporting Mr Akbari's family and had repeatedly raised his case with Iranian authorities. It has requested urgent consular access, but Iran's government does not recognise dual nationality for Iranians.BBC Persian also broadcast an audio message on Wednesday from Mr Akbari in which he says he was tortured and forced to confess on camera to crimes he did not commit. He says that he was living abroad a few years ago when he was invited to visit Iran at the request of a top Iranian diplomat who was involved in nuclear talks with world powers.Once there, he adds, he was accused of obtaining top secret intelligence from the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, \"in exchange for a bottle of perfume and a shirt\".Mr Akbari served under Mr Shamkhani when the latter was defence minister during the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, a reformist who was in office for two terms between 1997 and 2005.Mr Akbari alleges in the audio message that he was \"interrogated and tortured\" by intelligence agents \"for more than 3,500 hours\". \"During all those 3,500 hours, which took more than 10 months, they were recording my confessions with 10 cameras to make their Hollywood-style film,\" he says, adding that he was also given \"psychedelic drugs\".\"By using physiological and psychological methods, they broke my will, drove me to madness and forced me to do whatever they wanted. By the force of gun and death threats they made me confess to false and corrupt claims.\"He also accuses Iran of seeking \"to take revenge on the UK by executing me\".Hours after the audio message was broadcast, the Iranian judiciary's Mizan news agency confirmed for the first time that Mr Akbari had been found guilty of espionage, and that the Supreme Court had rejected his appeal.It cited Iran's intelligence ministry as saying that Mr Akbari had been \"one of the most important infiltrators of the country's sensitive and strategic centres\" for the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, better known as MI6, and that he had been \"compiling and consciously transferring sensitive information\".  The ministry claimed that its agents uncovered Mr Akbari's spying by feeding him false information.At the end of November, Iranian state media reported that authorities had hanged four men convicted of \"co-operating\" with Israeli intelligence.Four other men have been executed since December after being sentenced to death in connection with the anti-government protests engulfing the country.Alicia Kearns, chair of the UK House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, said the news from Mr Akbari's family was \"awful\". She speculated that Mr Akbari might have been singled out by hard-liners in the establishment in order to undermine Mr Shamkhani, who she described as a \"moderate voice... [who] has been calling for discussions and dialogue\" in response to the current protests. Iran's current leaders have portrayed them as \"riots\" and cracked down on them with lethal force.Iran has arrested dozens of Iranians with dual nationality or foreign permanent residency in recent years, mostly on spying and national security charges.British-Iranian citizens Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori were released and allowed to leave Iran last year after the UK settled a long-standing debt owed to Iran.

      " the p tags is: When you arrive in China now the officials in head-to-toe protective clothing are gone. There are no buses with special plastic dividers waiting to take you to centralised quarantine. The main reminder that Covid is still around is that people are wearing masks.It feels weird.You still need a PCR test before flying and arriving passengers fill in a health declaration form, accessible via phone apps. This then generates a temporary QR code. You scan the code when you come through the airport and then, after clearing immigration, simply walk out and into China.As a journalist, I had to wait for an hour for special clearance to enter. During that time I and another waiting reporter had a long chat with one of the immigration police.It was the first day they didn't have to wear the \"da bai\" (big white) protective gear over their uniforms or face shields or shoe covers. Was it a relief?\"Yeah, it actually wasn't that bad,\" he said.Chinese New Year is fast approaching but this officer said he would not be heading back to his hometown to ring in the Year of the Rabbit. There would be too much work for the immigration police over the coming weeks making sure that the new travel systems were in place and operating, he said.Getting rid of most zero-Covid travel restrictions before the Spring Festival has meant that many who have not been able to visit friends and relatives in China are rushing to buy plane and train tickets in time. Then there are the Chinese citizens who haven't been able to go overseas for years - they too are making plans again. Most observers expect international tourists will soon be allowed back in.The speed of the change in China's Covid approach has been breathtaking.Discontent had been building for a long time, but once demonstrators started chanting publicly that leader Xi Jinping should resign and the Communist Party give up power, that was more than even this country's all-powerful government could bear.The end of mass-testing, city-wide lockdowns and centralised quarantine sent Covid flying through the Chinese population.Big city hospitals were soon being swamped. Social media is full of images of hospital corridors packed with elderly patients on oxygen support.The real death toll is unknown. China's health officials announced that they would not be counting deaths from other causes among the Covid statistics, even if coronavirus indirectly caused a patient to die by triggering other health problems. As a result, the official death toll is being ridiculed by Chinese people.One woman told the BBC about the death of her mother-in-law. Her story paints a picture of a funeral system under huge strain, suggesting the Covid death toll is considerable.First it was impossible to get an ambulance to rush her mother-in-law to hospital, she said. Then after she died her body was at one point stored on the floor in a room full of corpses.She said she had been told that Beijing had temporarily transformed a cold storage site so that it could accommodate bodies. It took more than a week for her family to get a slot at the crematorium for a funeral service and when we spoke to her they were still waiting for the cemetery to give them a location to place the urn containing her mother-in-law's remains.It is hard to convey the paradoxical mood in China right now. There are those who have lost loved ones or have had a bad dose of Covid - but there is also considerable joy because the country is re-opening. Government officials say many provinces and cities have passed the peak of infections.The new year mass migration has already started. You see people wheeling their luggage in the direction of the train stations, carrying gifts for their families. Tens of millions of people have already travelled with an estimated two billion trips expected.In Beijing's Jianguomen district, a 53-year-old woman working in a little shop selling nuts told us she had not been home for the new year since the Covid crisis began. \"I can't wait to go home. I've been working hard all year,\" she said. \"I want to see my parents who are getting old. My kids are there too. They're all looking forward to my return. We can have a family reunion and ring in the new year together!\"She says she feels guilty for being away from home for so long. Her 84-year-old father and 77-year-old mother have both caught the virus and recovered, as has she. So she said they could get on with normal life now.A few doors down is a noodle restaurant and a couple in their 50s who work there are on their break. Their boss still hasn't told them whether they can have time off to travel back to their hometown in the eastern Anhui province.They hadn't been home in three years ether. \"We've lost a lot of money during the Covid crisis yet rent remains the same. So we just keep working.\"Don't they want to go home this year?\"Of course, we'd love to but we don't have the money,\" they say together. The woman explains that their restaurant being forced to close for dine-in services for months on end hit them hard financially.Have their parents, aged in their 80s and 90s, caught Covid?\"They must have got it,\" the man says. \"There were no test kits in our hometown but they felt unwell, got a fever and coughed a lot. Took some medicine and recovered.\"Outside the restaurant a mother with her six-year-old son tells us they won't be leaving Beijing any time soon. Though they've had Covid they say they're worried about catching it again in a second wave of infections.Further along the road there is a man with his son who have a completely different attitude. They're in Beijing on holiday. Neither of them have caught Covid yet but they say they're not worried. The father says his grandparents have already recovered from the virus back in their hometown in Zhengzhou, in central Henan province, and that they will be heading there soon for the Spring Festival.Images of rabbits are going up everywhere. They look cute and happy and seem to embody the optimism which is now spreading.It has been a tough few years in China but you'll hear people saying that during the Year of the Rabbit things are going to be so much better.And who can blame them for looking forward to better times?Nepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare \n",

This then generates a temporary QR code. You scan the code when you come through the airport and then, after clearing immigration, simply walk out and into China.As a journalist, I had to wait for an hour for special clearance to enter. During that time I and another waiting reporter had a long chat with one of the immigration police.It was the first day they didn't have to wear the \"da bai\" (big white) protective gear over their uniforms or face shields or shoe covers. Was it a relief?\"Yeah, it actually wasn't that bad,\" he said.Chinese New Year is fast approaching but this officer said he would not be heading back to his hometown to ring in the Year of the Rabbit. There would be too much work for the immigration police over the coming weeks making sure that the new travel systems were in place and operating, he said.Getting rid of most zero-Covid travel restrictions before the Spring Festival has meant that many who have not been able to visit friends and relatives in China are rushing to buy plane and train tickets in time. Then there are the Chinese citizens who haven't been able to go overseas for years - they too are making plans again. Most observers expect international tourists will soon be allowed back in.The speed of the change in China's Covid approach has been breathtaking.Discontent had been building for a long time, but once demonstrators started chanting publicly that leader Xi Jinping should resign and the Communist Party give up power, that was more than even this country's all-powerful government could bear.The end of mass-testing, city-wide lockdowns and centralised quarantine sent Covid flying through the Chinese population.Big city hospitals were soon being swamped. Social media is full of images of hospital corridors packed with elderly patients on oxygen support.The real death toll is unknown. China's health officials announced that they would not be counting deaths from other causes among the Covid statistics, even if coronavirus indirectly caused a patient to die by triggering other health problems. As a result, the official death toll is being ridiculed by Chinese people.One woman told the BBC about the death of her mother-in-law. Her story paints a picture of a funeral system under huge strain, suggesting the Covid death toll is considerable.First it was impossible to get an ambulance to rush her mother-in-law to hospital, she said. Then after she died her body was at one point stored on the floor in a room full of corpses.She said she had been told that Beijing had temporarily transformed a cold storage site so that it could accommodate bodies. It took more than a week for her family to get a slot at the crematorium for a funeral service and when we spoke to her they were still waiting for the cemetery to give them a location to place the urn containing her mother-in-law's remains.It is hard to convey the paradoxical mood in China right now. There are those who have lost loved ones or have had a bad dose of Covid - but there is also considerable joy because the country is re-opening. Government officials say many provinces and cities have passed the peak of infections.The new year mass migration has already started. You see people wheeling their luggage in the direction of the train stations, carrying gifts for their families. Tens of millions of people have already travelled with an estimated two billion trips expected.In Beijing's Jianguomen district, a 53-year-old woman working in a little shop selling nuts told us she had not been home for the new year since the Covid crisis began. \"I can't wait to go home. I've been working hard all year,\" she said. \"I want to see my parents who are getting old. My kids are there too. They're all looking forward to my return. We can have a family reunion and ring in the new year together!\"She says she feels guilty for being away from home for so long. Her 84-year-old father and 77-year-old mother have both caught the virus and recovered, as has she. So she said they could get on with normal life now.A few doors down is a noodle restaurant and a couple in their 50s who work there are on their break. Their boss still hasn't told them whether they can have time off to travel back to their hometown in the eastern Anhui province.They hadn't been home in three years ether. \"We've lost a lot of money during the Covid crisis yet rent remains the same. So we just keep working.\"Don't they want to go home this year?\"Of course, we'd love to but we don't have the money,\" they say together. The woman explains that their restaurant being forced to close for dine-in services for months on end hit them hard financially.Have their parents, aged in their 80s and 90s, caught Covid?\"They must have got it,\" the man says. \"There were no test kits in our hometown but they felt unwell, got a fever and coughed a lot. Took some medicine and recovered.\"Outside the restaurant a mother with her six-year-old son tells us they won't be leaving Beijing any time soon. Though they've had Covid they say they're worried about catching it again in a second wave of infections.Further along the road there is a man with his son who have a completely different attitude. They're in Beijing on holiday. Neither of them have caught Covid yet but they say they're not worried. The father says his grandparents have already recovered from the virus back in their hometown in Zhengzhou, in central Henan province, and that they will be heading there soon for the Spring Festival.Images of rabbits are going up everywhere. They look cute and happy and seem to embody the optimism which is now spreading.It has been a tough few years in China but you'll hear people saying that during the Year of the Rabbit things are going to be so much better.And who can blame them for looking forward to better times?Nepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare\n",

      " the p tags is: Last week, when Indian-origin lawyer Surendran K Pattel took the oath as a district judge in a US court, he made headlines back home because of his inspiring journey. BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi tells the story of a man who went from making hand-rolled cigarettes in India to becoming an arbiter of justice. Mr Pattel, 51, who is from the southern Indian state of Kerala, has been appointed a judge in the 240th Judicial District Court in Fort Bend County in Texas state.He was sworn in on 1 January, five years after he became a US citizen - his journey, Mr Pattel says, was all about \"hard work, determination and a lot of struggle\". \"But there were also a lot of people who supported and helped me at every stage of my life,\" he says, saying that the list is topped by his mother, whom he calls \"a symbol of sacrifice\". Mr Pattel spent his childhood in grinding poverty. His parents were labourers who depended on meagre daily wages to feed their six children. As a child, Mr Pattel would roll beedis - traditional cigarettes made by wrapping raw tobacco in leaves - \"so that we could have three meals a day\". \"My elder sister and I used to sit late into the night doing this,\" he says.As a teenager, he dropped out of school after not scoring well in his exams. He had almost accepted his lot in life when his eldest sister died, leaving behind a 15 month-old daughter.\"The case was determined to be a suicide but I felt that justice had not been done in the matter. It still haunts me,\" he told the BBC without giving more details about the incident.The tragedy spurred him to redefine his future and he rejoined school and studied hard. When he was in a two-year, pre-degree course before going to college, Mr Pattel often had to skip classes because he had to work too.In his first year, he had to plead with his teachers after they asked him not to take the final exams due to low attendance.  \"I didn't want to tell them that I wasn't going to class because of my financial situation because I didn't want sympathy,\" he says. His teachers gave him another chance - they only learnt later from his friends that he had no choice but to work.When the results came out, Mr Pattel surprised everyone by ranking second in his class. He also decided that his future lay in law. \"I never wanted to do anything else. I am so passionate about it,\" he says.Mr Pattel's financial situation continued to pose challenges but he was helped by the generosity of people he met along the way. One of them was a Mr Uttupp, who ran a hotel in Kerala. \"I told him if he did not give me a job, I would have to discontinue my education. He hired me as part of the housekeeping staff in the hotel,\" Mr Pattel says. The relationship continued until Mr Uttupp's death.  \"His brother Manuel even called me after the news broke that I had become a judge,\" Mr Pattel says. Mr Pattel got a degree in political science in 1992 before studying law. Four years later, he got a job with lawyer P Appukuttan and began working in the town of Hosdurg in Kerala's Kasaragod district. \"He was so enthusiastic that I trusted him. I entrusted all kinds of civil matters to him because he was capable of doing it,\" Mr Appukuttan told the BBC. Mr Pattel worked there for a decade until his wife, Subha, got a job at a hospital in India's capital Delhi. He decided to follow her because he \"never wanted to come in the way of her career\". In Delhi, he worked with a Supreme Court lawyer for a few months before his wife had to move again - this time to the US. \"Even though I wasn't happy about leaving my profession behind, I followed her. Without her, I would not have been where I am today,'' Mr Pattel says.   The couple moved to Texas in 2007, where Mr Pattel worked in a grocery store for some time before realising that he could take the Bar exam in Texas. He then went on to get a degree in international law.When Mr Pattel decided to run for the post of the judge with the Democratic Party, he had some unpleasant experiences - for instance, he was mocked for his Indian accent while campaigning, he says. \"But I was not hurt by it. Campaigns can be nasty sometimes. I think it doesn't matter how long you live here - what matters is how long you have served the community,\" he adds.  The American journey, he says, has been a rewarding one: \"I became a citizen only in 2017 and now in 2022, I have won an election. I don't think this can happen in any other country.\"His victory is also special for a personal reason.While practising in Texas, Mr Pattel became very close to a senior lawyer, Glenden B Adams.When Mr Adams died, his wife Rosalie Adams asked Mr Pattel to be a pallbearer. On Wednesday, when he began his new role, \"it was Rosalie Adams who put the robes on me at my private investiture in my courtroom\".

      " the p tags is: Amid the pandemic gloom, it is easy to forget that the year 2020 marks an important anniversary for women's rights. In the US, it has been 100 years since women cast their votes for the first time. A century ago in the United Kingdom, the first female law students were admitted to the Inns of Court.At Lincoln's Inn in London, one of those students, Mithan Lam, was an Indian. In 1924, she became the first woman to be allowed to practise law in the Bombay High Court, shattering one of the thickest glass ceilings for professional women in the country.But Lam's influence extended well beyond the bar: she left an indelible stamp on the female suffragist movement and the struggle for gender equality in India.Intrigued by a colourful badge Singh wore proclaiming \"Votes for Women,\" Lam and Tata were quickly drawn into the cause of Indian female suffrage. Suffrage was a contentious issue amongst nationalists in colonial India: should women's enfranchisement be prioritised over Indian independence? Lam saw no contradiction between the two demands, branding men's reservations against women's voting rights as \"soap-bubble material\". \"Men say 'Home Rule is our birthright',\" Tata stated in 1918, echoing a famous nationalist slogan. \"We say the right to vote is our birthright, and we want it.\"In the autumn of 1919, women's groups in Bombay decided to send representatives to London when the British Parliament was considering female suffrage in a package of political reforms for India - also known as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms. Lam, 21, and her mother were the natural choice, given their determined activism. Since they were given only four days notice before setting sail to England, they composed their parliamentary evidence on the boat.Tata and Lam's evidence highlighted the impossibility of meaningful political reform if half of India was excluded on the grounds of sex. \"Attempt to reform without the co-operation of women,\" they argued, \"and you are simply raising a paper fabric on foundations of sand.\"  While unsuccessful in their immediate objective, their evidence might have spurred the British Parliament to leave the decision about female suffrage to the discretion of the Indian provinces. In 1921, both Bombay and Madras presidencies granted limited women's franchise. Mother and daughter also captivated the British public with their passionate advocacy of Indian women's issues, earning the support of Ramsay MacDonald, the future British prime minister, and the feminist icon Millicent Fawcett.The newly minted lawyer sailed back to India in December 1923. It was a fortuitous time to return because that year, the Indian government removed disqualifications for women to practise law. Lam found herself in a daunting situation as the sole female lawyer in the male bastion of the Bombay High Court. \"I felt like a new animal at the zoo, with folks peeping through doorways,\" she recalled. \"As soon as my shadow crossed from the library to the common room, there would be an uncomfortable silence, making me feel even more self-conscious.\" Misogyny, ironically, might have played a role in landing Lam her first court appearance. According to a former Supreme Court judge, Lam was approached by a solicitor whose client had a watertight case. \"He has such a good case that he cannot lose,\" the solicitor claimed. \"But he wants to inflict upon the opponent the humiliation of being defeated by a woman.\" Within a few years, however, Lam built up a solid legal reputation. She appeared in an eclectic mix of cases in court, ranging from prosecuting currency counterfeiters to defending the validity of a Jewish betrothal.Outside of the courtroom, she helped shape gender-sensitive legislation for marriage and inheritance and became a prolific advocate of women's and children's rights. But she matched this legal activism with on-the-ground social work, shuttling between Bombay's elite drawing rooms and its teeming slums. Lam brought slum dwellers improved infrastructure and health facilities, helped resettle Partition refugees and led numerous social welfare activities of the All India Women's Conference.In 1947, the year of Indian independence, Lam added another first to her credit. She was appointed as the sheriff of Bombay, the first female sheriff in India. Years later, when she travelled the world as a representative of Indian women, this caused occasional puzzlement. San Francisco's sheriff took her for a visit to the city's prisons and gave her a police baton, not knowing that a sheriff in India occupied a largely ceremonial position. \"They were rather intrigued about the fact that a woman could be a sheriff, for in the US sheriffs are real police officers and have to be quick with the gun,\" she recalled.By the time she died in 1981, Lam had mentored generations of feminists, hopeful that the growing number of women in law would stimulate political and social reform in India. Her work - as well as the work of hundreds of other relatively unknown female pioneers - has paved the way for law becoming an increasingly popular career choice for Indian women today. This video can not be playedAnna Chandy: The story of India's first woman high court judgeExactly a century ago, Lam rallied against gender-based exclusion with a poignant question: \"How can the women be declared unfit without even being given a trial?\" Such words may hold a special resonance today with female trailblazers working their way up in traditionally patriarchal bastions, whether inside or outside the courtroom.Parinaz Madan is a lawyer and Dinyar Patel is a historian.Did the Empire resist womenâs suffrage in India?Parsi matrimonial courts: India's only surviving jury trialsThe woman who fights for men's rightsNepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare \n",

      " the p tags is: A Supreme Court panel in India has recommended the name of an openly gay lawyer to be a judge in what is being described as a \"milestone\" for LGBTQ rights. Legal journalist Suchitra Mohanty reports. The top court's collegium, a committee headed by the country's chief justice, has proposed senior advocate Saurabh Kirpal's name to become a Delhi High Court judge. The process of appointing a judge in India involves recommendations from the collegium followed by a formal approval from the federal government. It's widely believed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is likely to accept Mr Kirpal's name in the coming weeks.In 2018, the Supreme Court decriminalised gay sex in a landmark ruling which was seen as a huge victory for the country's LGBTQ population - Mr Kirpal was the lawyer for two key petitioners in the case.Attitudes on the ground, however, are changing at a slow pace as members of the community still face discrimination and harassment in daily life. Activists have called for specific laws to help the community fight the prejudices they face while trying to access jobs and healthcare. In fact, Mr Kirpal also believes that his sexual orientation came in the way of his appointment earlier. The collegium first considered him for the post in 2018, but deferred its decision at least thrice.\"The fact that my partner of 20 years is a person of foreign origin is a security risk is such a specious reason that it leaves one to believe that it is not the whole truth. That is the reason I believe my sexuality is the reason why my candidature has not been considered for elevation as a judge,\" the 49-year-old told a TV channel last year. His colleagues have welcomed the decision. Vikas Singh, a former additional solicitor general who has known Mr Kirpal for years, welcomed the collegium's decision.\"The country has evolved with the times,\" Mr Singh told the BBC. Senior lawyer Geeta Luthra also told the BBC that Mr Kirpal was \"bright\", \"exceptional\" and \"deserving\".\"Saurabh Kirpal's personal choice of sexual partner should have no role in his recommendation for being a judge in the Delhi High Court. We have to give precedence to merit and calibre,\" she said.Mr Kirpal studied physics at New Delhi's St. Stephen's College before going to Oxford University on a scholarship for a law degree. He also has a master's degree from Cambridge University.He worked briefly with the United Nations in Geneva before returning to India in the 1990s. Since then, he has practised in the Supreme Court, arguing several important cases in the fields of constitutional, commercial, civil and criminal law. He has also assisted former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi, a stint Mr Singh believes sharpened Mr Kirpal's skills and understanding of the law. Mr Kirpal has said that he considers two people as his biggest influences in the field of law - his father and Mr Rohatgi.Mr Kirpal's father, BN Kirpal, served as India's chief justice.Sharif D Rangnekar, a former journalist and author of Straight to Normal: My Life as a Gay Man, said the recommendation was a \"historic\" moment for the community.\"You never know how many more lawyers will now come out as queer, and not feel discriminated,\" he told the Press Trust of India.Nepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare \n",

The collegium first considered him for the post in 2018, but deferred its decision at least thrice.\"The fact that my partner of 20 years is a person of foreign origin is a security risk is such a specious reason that it leaves one to believe that it is not the whole truth. That is the reason I believe my sexuality is the reason why my candidature has not been considered for elevation as a judge,\" the 49-year-old told a TV channel last year. His colleagues have welcomed the decision. Vikas Singh, a former additional solicitor general who has known Mr Kirpal for years, welcomed the collegium's decision.\"The country has evolved with the times,\" Mr Singh told the BBC. Senior lawyer Geeta Luthra also told the BBC that Mr Kirpal was \"bright\", \"exceptional\" and \"deserving\".\"Saurabh Kirpal's personal choice of sexual partner should have no role in his recommendation for being a judge in the Delhi High Court. We have to give precedence to merit and calibre,\" she said.Mr Kirpal studied physics at New Delhi's St. Stephen's College before going to Oxford University on a scholarship for a law degree. He also has a master's degree from Cambridge University.He worked briefly with the United Nations in Geneva before returning to India in the 1990s. Since then, he has practised in the Supreme Court, arguing several important cases in the fields of constitutional, commercial, civil and criminal law. He has also assisted former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi, a stint Mr Singh believes sharpened Mr Kirpal's skills and understanding of the law. Mr Kirpal has said that he considers two people as his biggest influences in the field of law - his father and Mr Rohatgi.Mr Kirpal's father, BN Kirpal, served as India's chief justice.Sharif D Rangnekar, a former journalist and author of Straight to Normal: My Life as a Gay Man, said the recommendation was a \"historic\" moment for the community.\"You never know how many more lawyers will now come out as queer, and not feel discriminated,\" he told the Press Trust of India.Nepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare\n",

      " the p tags is: Buying a new smartphone was a bit of a mission for Deepa Aswani, who works in marketing in Mumbai.\"I am very particular about what phone I buy. I did not want to invest too much,\" she says.After two months of deliberation, she chose the OnePlus 10R, which in a sale cost her $400 (Â£329), a reasonable price for a smartphone, but still a significant sum in any country, and particularly in a developing one like India.\"The idea was to buy a phone which did not make a hole in my pocket and had good features. I am happy with the phone I have purchased,\" she says.Ms Aswani's new smartphone was made by a Chinese firm in India - a common arrangement these days.But as recently as 2014, the majority of phones sold in India would have been imported. That has all changed in recent years. In 2022 almost all phones sold in India were made there as well, according to the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA).Many of those phones would have been made by overseas firms with operations in India, like Taiwan's Foxconn or South Korea's Samsung.But the number of home-grown firms is increasing rapidly.Micromax Informatics is one of those challengers. It entered the mobile handset business in 2008. In just two years it grew to become one of India's biggest makers of cheaper phones, known as feature phones. Despite that growth, Micromax co-founder Rajesh Agarwal says it is hard to compete with Chinese smartphone makers.\"They have huge strength in terms of production,\" he says.On top of that, Chinese firms can source almost all of their components locally.India does make some parts, including chargers, cables and batteries, but the more sophisticated parts, like screens and computer chips are almost always made abroad.\"As far as the manufacturing is concerned - it is the beginning. We have to become our own kitchen where we are able to produce all our components locally,\" says Mr Agarwal.\"The final goal would be to transition from being a producer for domestic consumption to serving global demand, not just for phones but laptops, tablets and other devices,\" he adds.The Indian government is hoping to accelerate that move. In April 2021 it launched the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Telecom and Networking Equipment.It is the latest part of a government policy, which goes back years, aiming to increase all types of manufacturing in India.The PLI scheme subsidises mobile phone components that are made in India. It is hoped that will make them more competitive and boost production.According to the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), at the moment between 15% and 20% of the parts that make up an Indian phone are made in India. The aim of the PLI scheme is to raise that to between 35% and 40%.\"The production-linked incentive scheme is a game changer for electronics manufacturing,\" says ICEA chairman Pankaj Mohindroo.\"India is currently one of the fastest growing mobile phone manufacturers in the world and has emerged as the second largest manufacturer of mobile handsets in the world,\" he says.Mobile phones are the biggest single component of India's electronic exports and next year are expected to make up 50% of electronics exports, according to the ICEA.\"India will become the next global hub for cell phone manufacturers,\" predicts Hari Om Rai, the chairman of Indian phone maker Lava International.  He points out that China, as it has become richer and seen wages rising, has lost some of the cost advantage that it had over other nations.More technology of business:Also, Mr Om Rai says firms all over the world are worried about becoming overly reliant on products from China. If firms want to locate manufacturing elsewhere then, according to Mr Om Rai, India is an attractive option.\"India has 18% of the world's population, with a mere 3.1% of the GDP. As the country's GDP grows, it will become one of the world's largest markets. Looking at the long-term potential, every company is trying to establish itself and outcompete its competitors in India,\" he says.Back in Mumbai, all this industrial policy is of little interest to Deepa Aswani.\"It does not bother me where my smartphone is manufactured. I think as a consumer all that matters is budget and features,\" she says. \"As a smartphone buyer I would look at the country which has advanced technology and is pocket friendly.\"Nepal mourns victims of worst air disaster in decadesVR headset prices high as Apple bides its timePlan for a million Christians to visit Jesus siteYour pictures on the theme of 'open doors'Vladimir Komarov: The cosmonaut who fell to EarthChristian missionaries target the birthplace of BuddhaCanada wrestles with euthanasia for the mentally illNew Zealand egg shortage threatens pavlovaBritain's lost and legendary 'Area 51'The axed workers posting epic goodbyesThe skiers dedicated to alpine warfare \n",

      " the p tags is: Artworks generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become a source of controversy, but Nigerian filmmaker and artist Malik Afegbua is making a case that it can challenge us to create a better real world - and a more stylish one for older people.At first glance, his images look like they were snapped on the edge of a fashion runway, but these models are not actually real people.Instead, the pictures are the result of Afegbua's imagination working in conjunction with AI software, showing older-looking models in beautiful clothes.He knew he had created something special after he had posted them on social media. Especially after they caught the eye of the Oscar-winning costume designer behind the Black Panther films, Ruth Carter. \"This is so dope!!\" she wrote on Instagram.The series of images, called Fashion Show For Seniors, has attracted thousands of similar comments.With more than 100,000 likes for the pictures on social media, Afegbua's work has clearly made an impact in the real world. But questions linger about whether computer-generated work is a threat to human creativity. There are ethical issues as well.The artist, though, takes a thoughtful and nuanced approach. We are just about to get the Zoom interview started, with Afegbua sitting in his home office in Lagos, Nigeria - when his two-year-old son calls out for a bit of attention. \"He was born smart and everything he does is so techie. He already knows how to use mobile phones and iPads,\" he says proudly.It is clear that he is passing down his love of technology and art to his son, but what made this business-school graduate pivot into pursuing a creative career?\"Someone gifted me a camera and that's where it took off.\"  He became a filmmaker and now produces commercials, documentary films and virtual reality exhibitions. He also embraced the emergence of AI as a newly leading force in art.With his fashion show series, he saw an opportunity to challenge what he sees as the marginalisation of older people in society and wanted to challenge perceptions around ageing.\"I've never seen a fashion show for elderly people, but they exist - so why not?\"One obvious objection is that there are real elderly people, and real fashion designers, who could have been photographed in the real world.But for Afegbua it is the aspirational message behind the images that is crucial.He believes they can make people think: \"What if we start doing things in this way?\" There has been some backlash against the use of AI in art, centred around whether computers can truly replicate human creativity, but Afegbua sees this an exciting opportunity for artists to evolve.AI image software either takes key words (called prompts) that are suggested by the artist or uses uploaded photos, to create an image based on that information.What Afegbua says he is doing with his work is teaching AI to become more creative and, in turn, he makes new discoveries. \"Artificial intelligence learns from us and learns from the World Wide Web. I try to learn from it as well. I try to learn how to talk to it, how to communicate better to get exact results from it.\"For the Fashion Show for Seniors pictures, Afegbua went back and forth with several AI-image generators - he uses three different ones for a variety of results - to find a look that was just right for his \"models\". \"I'm a lover of fashion, and I always like to experiment.

      " the title tag is: The Nigerian AI artist reimagining a stylish old age - BBC News\n",
      "Artworks generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become a source of controversy, but Nigerian filmmaker and artist Malik Afegbua is making a case that it can challenge us to create a better real world - and a more stylish one for older people.At first glance, his images look like they were snapped on the edge of a fashion runway, but these models are not actually real people.Instead, the pictures are the result of Afegbua's imagination working in conjunction with AI software, showing older-looking models in beautiful clothes.He knew he had created something special after he had posted them on social media. Especially after they caught the eye of the Oscar-winning costume designer behind the Black Panther films, Ruth Carter. \"This is so dope!!\" she wrote on Instagram.The series of images, called Fashion Show For Seniors, has attracted thousands of similar comments.With more than 100,000 likes for the pictures on social media, Afegbua's work has clearly made an impact in the real world. But questions linger about whether computer-generated work is a threat to human creativity. There are ethical issues as well.The artist, though, takes a thoughtful and nuanced approach. We are just about to get the Zoom interview started, with Afegbua sitting in his home office in Lagos, Nigeria - when his two-year-old son calls out for a bit of attention. \"He was born smart and everything he does is so techie. He already knows how to use mobile phones and iPads,\" he says proudly.It is clear that he is passing down his love of technology and art to his son, but what made this business-school graduate pivot into pursuing a creative career?\"Someone gifted me a camera and that's where it took off.\"  He became a filmmaker and now produces commercials, documentary films and virtual reality exhibitions. He also embraced the emergence of AI as a newly leading force in art.With his fashion show series, he saw an opportunity to challenge what he sees as the marginalisation of older people in society and wanted to challenge perceptions around ageing.\"I've never seen a fashion show for elderly people, but they exist - so why not?\"One obvious objection is that there are real elderly people, and real fashion designers, who could have been photographed in the real world.But for Afegbua it is the aspirational message behind the images that is crucial.He believes they can make people think: \"What if we start doing things in this way?\" There has been some backlash against the use of AI in art, centred around whether computers can truly replicate human creativity, but Afegbua sees this an exciting opportunity for artists to evolve.AI image software either takes key words (called prompts) that are suggested by the artist or uses uploaded photos, to create an image based on that information.What Afegbua says he is doing with his work is teaching AI to become more creative and, in turn, he makes new discoveries. \"Artificial intelligence learns from us and learns from the World Wide Web. I try to learn from it as well. I try to learn how to talk to it, how to communicate better to get exact results from it.\"For the Fashion Show for Seniors pictures, Afegbua went back and forth with several AI-image generators - he uses three different ones for a variety of results - to find a look that was just right for his \"models\". \"I'm a lover of fashion, and I always like to experiment. I wanted to mix traditional African Nigerian fashion with something futuristic, something Afro-futuristic.\"Another set of pictures, which he calls his Fiction series, is also inspired by an idea of the future - despite dating the world he has created to 250,000 years ago.

A.I. won. Humans lost\", he told the paper.Mr Allen earned just $300 (Â£262) from the contest, but the news struck a tender nerve. Some artists were already fearful that a new breed of AI image generator could take their jobs, and take a free ride on the years spent learning their craft.\"This thing wants our jobs, it's actively anti-artist\", wrote California-based movie and game concept artist RJ Palmer in a Tweet liked more than 25,000 times.In Twitter posts he highlighted how well the output of AI systems could imitate living artists. In one case he examined, the AI even attempted to reproduce artists' signatures. The output of these AI systems is impressive, but they are built upon the output of flesh-and-blood creators - their AIs are trained on millions of human-made images.Stable Diffusion, a recently launched open-source AI image generator, learns from a compressed file of \"100,000 gigabytes of images\" scraped from the internet, its founder Emad Mostaque tells me.Mr Mostaque, a computer scientist with a background in tech and finance, sees the Stable Diffusion as a \"generative search engine\".Whereas Google image searches show you pictures that already exist, Stable Diffusion shows you anything you can imagine.\"This is a  Star Trek Holodeck moment\" he says.Artists have always learned from and been influenced by others - \"great artists steal\" as the saying goes - but Mr Palmer says of AI is not just like finding inspiration in the work of other artists: \"This is directly stealing their essence in a way\".And AI can reproduce a style in seconds: \"Right now, if an artist wants to copy my style, they might spend a week trying to replicate it,\" Mr Palmer tells me.\"That's one person spending a week to create one thing. With this machine, you can produce hundreds of them a week\".But Mr Mostaque says he's not worried about putting artists out of work - the project is a tool like Microsoft's spreadsheet software Excel, which - he notes - \"didn't put the accountants out of work, I still pay my accountants\".So what is his message to young artists worried about their future career, perhaps in illustration or design? \"My message to them would be, 'illustration design jobs are very tedious'. It's not about being artistic, you are a tool\".He suggests they find opportunities using the new technology: \"This is a sector that's going to grow massively. Make money from this sector if you want to make money, it'll be far more fun\".And there are already artists using AI art for inspiration and to make money.OpenAI say their DALL-E AI system is used by more than 3,000 artists from more than 118 countries.But although there is a lot of anger about the way AIs use artists' work, experts say legal challenges may be difficult. Professor Lionel Bently, director of the Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Law at Cambridge University, says that in the UK \"it's not an infringement of copyright, in general, to use the style of somebody else\".Professor Bently tells me an artist would need to show that output of an AI had reproduced a significant part of their original creative expression in a particular piece of their art used to train the AI.Even where that's possible - not many artists will have the means to fight such legal battles.The Design and Artists Copyright Society (DACS), which collects payments on behalf of artists for the use of their images, is worried.I asked DACS' head of policy Reema Selhi if artists' livelihoods are at stake. \"Absolutely yes,\" she says.DACS is not against the use of AI in art, but Ms Selhi wants artists, whose work is used by AI image systems to make money, to be rewarded fairly and have control over how their works are used.\"There are no safeguards for artists [..] to be able to identify works in databases that are being used and opt out\" she adds.Artists might be able to claim copyright infringement when an image is scraped from the internet in order to be used to train an AI - although legal experts I spoke to suggested a number of reasons why such a claim might fail.Mr Mostaque says he understood artists' fears and frustrations, noting that \"you saw this with photography as well\".He said the project was working with \"technology industry leaders to create mechanisms by which artists can upload their portfolios and request for their styles not to be used in online services using this and similar technology\".Google warned that the datasets of scraped images used to train AI's often included pornography, reflected social stereotypes, and contained \"derogatory, or otherwise harmful, associations to marginalized identity groups\".Mr Mostaque says that kind of unethical use \"breaks the license terms\". And he says the software already filters out attempts to create not-safe-for-work imagery, although that can be worked around by the technically savvy.But  the onus, he says, is \"upon the person doing something illegal\", and other existing tools can also be abused, for example someone could use \"Photoshop's merge tool to stick someone's head on a nude\".And there are some big names connected to the development of the tech. The \"techno-king\" himself Elon Musk is a backer of OpenAI.Far from being \"derivative goo\", they say DALL-E assists human creativity and produces \"unique, original images that have never existed before\".For a final opinion, I rang up contemporary artist and broadcaster Bob-and-Roberta-Smith (the name belongs to just one artist). He's had work in the big galleries, and will be staging an artistic takeover of the shop in London's Tate Modern gallery in October.He works in old-school physical media mainly but he thinks AI could be an interesting area of artistic activity, in the tradition of the mash-up. But policy makers, he says, need to get the rules right, \"so nobody feels ripped off\", and money isn't just siphoned off from artists and into the pockets of big corporations.

Here's a look at some of the things we still don't know. Mr Biden has said he does not know what's in the recovered papers.

It also reported that some of the documents were labelled as top secret, the highest level of classification.We know less about the second set of documents. On Thursday, Mr Biden's personal lawyer issued a statement that said the files were \"Obama-Biden Administration records\" meaning these, too, date back to his eight years as vice-president.

But it's still unclear who may have handled these files in the seven years since Mr Biden ended his tenure as vice-president.The only hints we may have are where they were found. The first set of files was discovered by Mr Biden's lawyers in what the White House described as a locked closet of the president's office at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a think tank in Washington.

Congressional Republicans have demanded to see visitor logs for Mr Biden's homes, arguing that the discovery of the files at one of his residences is a national security risk.According to the White House, Mr Biden's lawyers first found classified documents on 2 November - just one week before the midterm elections. The administration said it reported the discovery that very day to the National Archives, who retrieved the materials on 3 November and referred the matter to the justice department. It was not until reporting this month by CBS News that the discovered documents were made public or acknowledged by the White House, spurring accusations that it had been deliberately kept quiet ahead of the midterms.\"He knowingly knew this happened going into [the] election, going into interviews. This is what makes America not trust their government,\" Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said.The White House, meanwhile, has denied that there was a calculated delay to going public.Mr Biden has said he was \"surprised\" to learn there were classified documents found in his old office. It's not clear when, exactly, he learned of their existence.But keeping such a discovery private is \"normal\", said David Weinstein, a formal federal prosecutor in Florida. \"It's not your place as a target or a witness of an investigation to say what happened, it's up to the people investigating it to decide what to say and when to say it,\" he said.It's too early to say whether the president or any of his associates will face legal penalties.We know that the newly-appointed Special Counsel Robert Hur will examine \"the possible unauthorised removal and retention of classified documents\" - an offence under the US criminal code.

      " the p tags is: US President Joe Biden's aides have found a fresh batch of classified government records at a second location, in a growing political embarrassment for the White House.The first cache was found at a private office in Washington DC that Mr Biden used after his vice-presidency.The matter is under review by the US Department of Justice.Former President Donald Trump is facing a criminal investigation for allegedly mishandling classified files.It was not yet clear on Wednesday when or where the additional tranche of files was found by Biden aides. The original batch of about 10 documents was discovered in November at the Penn Biden Center, a think tank near the White House, but only came to light this week.Those papers reportedly include US intelligence memos and briefing materials related to Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom.They relate to his time as vice-president under President Barack Obama but it is unclear why they turned up in a private office he started using after that.Access to classified documents is limited by law to people with special authorisation and there are rules about how they are kept and stored.All White House records, including classified ones, are required to be turned over to the US National Archives after an administration's time in office.The White House has not yet commented on the newly discovered batch.

      "US President Joe Biden's aides have found a fresh batch of classified government records at a second location, in a growing political embarrassment for the White House.The first cache was found at a private office in Washington DC that Mr Biden used after his vice-presidency.The matter is under review by the US Department of Justice.Former President Donald Trump is facing a criminal investigation for allegedly mishandling classified files.It was not yet clear on Wednesday when or where the additional tranche of files was found by Biden aides. The original batch of about 10 documents was discovered in November at the Penn Biden Center, a think tank near the White House, but only came to light this week.Those papers reportedly include US intelligence memos and briefing materials related to Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom.They relate to his time as vice-president under President Barack Obama but it is unclear why they turned up in a private office he started using after that.Access to classified documents is limited by law to people with special authorisation and there are rules about how they are kept and stored.All White House records, including classified ones, are required to be turned over to the US National Archives after an administration's time in office.The White House has not yet commented on the newly discovered batch. However, the find has been confirmed by the BBC's US partner CBS and other US media.During her daily press briefing on Wednesday, Biden press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to answer questions about the first cache of files.\"This is under review by the Department of Justice,\" she said. \"I'm not going to go beyond what the president shared yesterday.\"She was pressed on why it took two months for the news to be made public and refused to say when Mr Biden had been briefed on it.

      " the p tags is: This video can not be playedWatch: Biden says documents weren't sitting out on the streetAt times, Joe Biden is his own worst enemy.When asked on Thursday whether it was true he had kept classified documents in a garage next to his sports car, he responded in a rather flippant manner that the garage was locked.That will lead some to wonder about the protestations from the White House that they are taking seriously the matter of whether Mr Biden mishandled classified materials after leaving the office of vice-president in 2017.But the justice department's appointment of a special counsel will concentrate minds and will undoubtedly overshadow the president's next months in office.He will also, eventually, have to answer the question of why it took so long to tell the public what had happened. The first batch was discovered a week before the midterm elections last November; did political considerations at the time colour the decisions that were made?It does not help matters that the second batch of documents, allegedly discovered by aides for the first time on Wednesday, were at his home in Wilmington, Delaware. In the two years he has been president, Mr Biden has logged 60 trips back to his home state, according to former CBS News correspondent and unofficial presidential statistics guru Mark Knoller. Locked or not, who else had access to the garage?No doubt Mr Biden's supporters and lawyers will argue there are key differences between the way Donald Trump behaved, with regard to his own alleged mishandling of documents, and how President Biden and his aides have handled the matter. It is true Mr Trump held on to hundreds of classified documents, failed to hand them all over when asked, and faced an FBI search warrant when the authorities lost patience with his lawyers. In contrast, Mr Biden's lawyers say that his case involves a small number of papers, the retention of which was inadvertent, and that they have co-operated at every stage.But those distinctions may pass most Americans by, leaving the Biden administration tarred with the same brush as its predecessor, damaging any claim it might have had to be pursuing the moral high ground.And with inflation falling and his approval ratings rebounding, the document discoveries will trim Mr Biden's sails as he prepares to campaign for re-election in 2024.An announcement on that was expected in the next few weeks.

Mr Hur has also clerked for the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, a conservative jurist who was appointed to the Supreme Court by Ronald Reagan.Thomas Dupree, a former Deputy Assistant Attorney General who works alongside Mr Hur at Gibson, Dunn & Cratcher, described him as \"a very talented lawyer, a man of excellent judgment and a man of the highest integrity\".\"I think it was an excellent choice by the Attorney General to put someone of Rob's calibre in this role,\" he said.As special counsel, Mr Hur will have the authority to prosecute any crimes identified during the probe or to refer any matters for prosecution by federal attorneys.
